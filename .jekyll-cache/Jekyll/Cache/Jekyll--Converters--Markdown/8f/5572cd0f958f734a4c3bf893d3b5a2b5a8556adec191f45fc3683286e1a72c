I"]<p>Whenever I see a historic marker in Vermont, I have to stop and look at it. You never know what might have happened in this very spot two hundred years ago– a future president born, a revolutionary war battle, or a whole industrial apparatus alive in this now-empty meadow. In addition to formally recognizing such sites with that classic green plaque, the State has also posted a list of their locations (albeit in a hard to read/harder to download iframe table format) on their <a href="http://historicsites.vermont.gov/roadside_markers/list">website</a>.<br />
<br />
Seeing a list of locations in the state, my first instinct was to map it. Looking at the dataset further, however, I realized that less than half of the entries had an actual latitude and longitude. Most locations were fairly well described- “intersection of Brook Rd and Thaddeus Stevens Rd”- but some just called out nearby landmarks, i.e. “near the village”. With the help of auxilary sources such as <a href="http://www.waymarking.com/cat/details.aspx?f=1&amp;guid=9cd074cf-33c7-4e49-8c79-0cde5f9c39a6&amp;st=2">wayfaring.com</a> and the <a href="http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com">Historical Marker Project</a>, as well as various town and city websites, I set out to georeference the remaining markers.<br />
<br />
This research is not what I’d prefer to spend my free time on, but any project requires data cleanup, and some more than others. I was able to locate all but three historic markers. They are, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>State Seal Pine Tree, North of Route 313 &amp; West of 7, Arlington</li>
  <li>D.P. Thompson, Montpelier - Barre Rd, Montpelier</li>
  <li>Levi P. Morton, Route 22A, north of village, Shoreham</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Mapping the remaining 200+ markers was an interesting exercise. From my time in Burlington, I’ve definitely noticed a lot of markers there– celebrating Ethan Allen, various Civil War regiments, and the creation of the pedestrian mecca that is Church St, among other things. Seeing them all on a map (fourteen in total) made me start to think about historical marker distribution. Investigation of other high-density historical marker areas (I’m looking at you Woodstock and Dorset) only led to more questions. Questions like . . . why doesn’t Barre have a single historic marker, and Woodstock has five?<br />
<br />
I suspect it might have a little something to with tourism, and with the motivated local governments that submit such historic prose to the State. Here’s one of my favorite examples of a ‘historic’ marker, this in the village of Belmont, but that could easily apply to any hamlet in the state:</p>
