I"¸<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Charlie Hofmann, the geographer/data junkie/wannabe programmer behind Mapping Vermont. I currently work as a GIS analyst in VT, and am hoping to use this blog as an opportunity to get outside my esri comfort zone. Iâ€™ll be putting together webmaps and graphics with Leaflet and D3, while trying to develop some sense of design/style along the way.<br />
<br />
In addition to improving my programming skills, I hope to dig deeper into Vermont culture and history. I grew up in Grafton, VT, and have always been fascinated by the diverse landscapes across the state. I attribute a great deal of this interest to my place-based elementary school education and to one particular local history-obsessed teacher. In the time before widespread standardized testing, we often wandered around town, visiting the historical society and hearing stories about life in Grafton long ago.<br />
<br />
Most posts here will likely skew more toward the technical rather than the local history side. While I realize that using Javascript to pull data from a Google Spreadsheet into Leaflet might not captivate the Vermont history audience, I hope that the resulting webmap will be of interest. Weâ€™ll see.</p>
