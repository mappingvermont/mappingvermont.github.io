I"€<p>Mapping Vermont is a project to collect, develop and map non-traditional datasets within the state. The blog will also examine technologyâ€“ how to give people the ability to make maps, share photos and audio, and tell their own stories. If you have a cool dataset to share, or a story youâ€™d like to tell, send me an email: charlie [dot] lefrak [at] gmail [dot] com. Thanks!</p>
