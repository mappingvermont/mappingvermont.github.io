I"ã<p>Iâ€™m not much of a hockey fan, but my buddy <a href="https://bobsbreakdowns.wordpress.com/">Bob Fitch</a> showed me a great API that lists information for every player in the NHL (example: <a href="http://nhlwc.cdnak.neulion.com/fs1/nhl/league/teamroster/bos/iphone/clubroster.json">Boston</a>). Included in this info is the playerâ€™s vital stats, twitter handle, and, most importantly, their birthplace. If thereâ€™s one thing better than an API, itâ€™s an API with really cool geographic data.<br />
<br />
Per always, I put together a <a href="https://github.com/mappingvermont/nhl-birthplaces/blob/master/geocodeBirthplace.py">python script</a> to geocode these towns using Googleâ€™s geocoder. I wrote the output to a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/mappingvermont/nhl-birthplaces/tree/master/outGeoJSON">geoJSON files</a>- both team-specific and all players in the NHL. From here I put this data into in my standard mapping template, and added a filter to allow users to show/hide data by team.<br />
<br />
Hereâ€™s the application: <a href="/projects/nhl-birthplaces">https://www.mappingvermont.org/projects/nhl-birthplaces</a><br />

Unfortunately there are no current NHL players from VT, but we do have the immortal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_LeClair">John LeClair</a> to our credit. Next up, weâ€™ll look through <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/">Sean Lahmanâ€™s baseball database</a> for evidence of Vermont athletic prowess.</p>
