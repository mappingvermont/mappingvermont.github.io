I"d<p>When I first started this website in 2013, one of my goals was to track my progress in the 251 Club. I had it all planned out– I’d
keep track of my progress in a Google spreadsheet and join the data dynamically to a Leaflet map for visualization. After I got this up and
running, I could add different tabs for friends who wanted to map their towns. Not at all intuitive or scalable, but totally fun!
<br />
<br />
In the years since, I’ve set my web development sights a little bit higher. Why not make this an actual “production” website, where
users could have a profile and edit their progress on an actual map? I had some experience with Leaflet, and had been wanting to try out
the MEAN stack for development. I found a <a href="https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/MEAN-stack-authentication">great tutorial</a> on MEAN
user management and was off to the races.
<br />
<br />
The rest, as they say is history. If you’re interested, please create a profile here and start tracking your progress:
