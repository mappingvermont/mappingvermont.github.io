I"ˆ<p>Until recently, my girlfriend produced podcasts for the New Republic. In addition to her work on <a href="https://newrepublic.com/authors/primary-concerns">Primary Concerns</a> and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/tags/intersection">Intersection</a>, she also helped manage TNRâ€™s social media presence.<br />
<br />
A large part of her social media work was watching TNRâ€™s <a href="http://newrepublic.com/minutes">minutes</a> site for new content. For each new minute, she would copy the headline, grab the associated image, and add them to <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a>, the app TNR uses to schedule its tweets. This isnâ€™t the most thrilling work, and can be downright annoying when trying to edit a podcast on a deadline.<br />
<br />
To help automate this process, I wrote some code to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scrape the TNR Minutes page once per minute</li>
  <li>Compare this data to previous posts saved in a local SQLite database</li>
  <li>Identify new posts based on the unique minute ID</li>
  <li>If a new post was found, compose a tweet with the headline and image</li>
  <li>Post the tweet to Buffer, and send her a Slack message of the tweet</li>
</ul>

<p>Not the most captivating of projects (where are the maps??), but cool to build something that makes my girlfriendâ€™s life easier. We also integrated a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0wCIi_ZV4mHFyGyQs3DqidCSUZD4pifj74IedKMVr0/edit#gid=0">Google Sheet</a> to pass environment variables to the app. Using the Google Doc, she could turn the system on/off and edit the time delay for the tweets.<br />
<br />
I love building projects that meet the user where theyâ€™re atâ€“ writing custom code to integrate with their end product while communicating to them through familiar systems like Slack and Google Sheets. If youâ€™re interested, the code is <a href="https://github.com/mappingvermont/tnrminutes">here</a> on GitHub.</p>
