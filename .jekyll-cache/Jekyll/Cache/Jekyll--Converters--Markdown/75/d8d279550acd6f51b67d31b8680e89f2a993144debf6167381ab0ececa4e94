I"…	<p>Iâ€™ve spent an inordinate amount of time stitching Sanborn maps into town-wide tifs,
georeferencing them, and then creating map tiles to view on the web. The results often
vary depending on DPI of the scanned maps, the software I use to stitch,
and the quality of my georeferencing, but itâ€™s always fun to
to try and understand the geography of these early settlements.
<br />
<br />
This process also allows one to pan and zoom over the map, which often leads
to interesting discoveries outside the larger dominant industriesâ€“ a
fish market in a small corner store, or the city stable for the fire departmentâ€™s horses.
Here are a few of my favorite examples:
<br />

<br />
Kow-Kure, the predecessor to Bag Balm, in Lyndonville in 1900
<br />
<br />
But how to browse all through all the available maps without taking the time to
stitch and georeference each one? When my <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh?hl=en">Earth View new tab extension</a> broke a few weeks ago, I decided to create one of my own for Vermont Sanborn Maps.
<br />
<br />
As always, the hard part was getting the data. The Library of Congress has a few different
APIs for serving this data, so I wrote some python to code read the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/sanborn/states.php?stateID=52">source page</a>, then check each
city for the years available, then download each sheet.
<br />
<br />
I uploaded this images to an S3 bucket (s3://vermont-sanborn-maps), where
they would be easily accessible. I found a few tutorials about creating chrome
extensions, and with 50 lines of JavaScript and HTML, I put together a simple
viewer to load a random Sanborn map every time a new tab is opened.
<br />
<br />
All the code is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/mappingvermont/sanborn-chrome-extension">here</a>, and the extension from the Chrome Store here:
