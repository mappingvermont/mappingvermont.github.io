Inaugural address of  Urban A. Woodbury  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1894  Thursday, October 4, 1894 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:  Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  we  the  stewards  and  servants  of  the  people,  have  assembled here to perform the several duties which are therein prescribed for us. If we have an adequate conception of our obligations  to  our  fellow  citizens  it  will  be  shown  by  wise  legislation  in  their  behalf.  We  meet  under circumstances which call for great thankfulness. During the past two years the people of our beloved State have been  spared  from wasting  pestilence,  from  the  ravages  of  fire  and  flood  and  other  providential  inflictions.  The labors  of  our  people  have  been  fairly  rewarded  and  contentment  and  plenty  are  in  our  homes.  We  have  been largely  spared  the  sufferings with which many  of  the  people  of  our  sister States  have  been  afflicted;  sufferings which were caused largely by a threatened and finally accomplished change in our National industrial policy. It is my duty as well as my privilege to bring to your attention matters which are important for your consideration. The  reports  of  the  several  officers  and  boards  are  comprehensive  and  complete,  and  I  think  it  would  be  a wearisome and useless repetition for me to detail to you what they show. I have made a few deductions from the Treasurer’s and Auditor’s Reports which may be of interest and value to you. FINANCES. The  report  of  the  Treasurer  shows  that  the  State  is  as  usual  in  a  good  financial  condition.  Its  only  funded liability is the Agricultural College fund represented by registered bonds of the State of ....  $135.500.00 Expenses of the State for last biennial term, were  ................................................................ 920,397.48 For preceding biennial term, ..................................................................................................  1,031,710.92 The average for seven biennial terms, ................................................................................... 722,740.90 There should be added to the expense of the last biennial term the unpaid bills of the Vermont State Asylum, accrued before July 1, 1894, say,.............................................................................................................. Which properly belonged to that term, making the total expenses for the term, ........................................................................... It is possible that there are other deferred payments probably chargeable to the last term.  It is estimated by the Treasurer that there be  available for the expenses of the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1895, was,. .......................................................................................... Deducting from this the amount of unpaid bills of the Vermont State Asylum accrued before July 1st. of  .............................................................................................. Would leave  .......................................................................................................................... The estimate of the Treasurer of the amount available for the fiscal year ending June 3, 1893, was  .................................................................................................................... Showing available funds of  ................................................................................................... More for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1895, than there were for the year ending June 30th, 1893.  If our Grand List is as large as that of 1893 ...........................................................................  1,751,745.23 428,822.48 42,832.61 18,000.00 471,655.09 18,000.00 938,397.48 489,655.09  a tax of 15 cents in addition to the corporation taxes ought to pay the expenses of the State for the next biennial term including the special appropriations which I have hereinafter recommend. The  expenses  of  the  State  are  controlled  largely  by  the  Legislative  Branch  of  the  Government,  The Executive  is directed by  the Constitution  to see  that  the  laws are faithfully executed and  it  is his duty  to control the  expenditures  within  the  limits  of  law.  He  can  also  have  influence  as  to  the  expenditures  of  the  various institutions,  commissions,  etc.,  but  however  much  he  may  or  can  do  the  responsibility  rests  mainly,  as  it  was intended by the fathers who framed our wise Constitution, with the legislative branch. TAXATION. The  report  of  the  Tax  Commissioner  indicates  that  the  corporations  generally  have  very  promptly  and willingly  paid  their  taxes.  Our  system  of  taxation  is  probably  as  nearly  equitable  as  it  can  be made  at  present. The  amount  of  corporation  taxes  collected  has  constantly  increased  during  the  ten  years  the  law  has  been  in force, from..............................................................................................................................  $ 186,698.51 In 1883, to .............................................................................................................................. 343,090.54 In  1893. These  taxes, with  the  license  taxes, furnished  the  last  biennial  term,  72½   per cent, or ....................................................................................................................... of the money raised for State expenses. The State tax of 15 cents, yielded 27½  per cent., or .............................................................  Of  the  corporation  taxes  the  savings  banks paid  38 8/10 per cent., or .................................................................................................. The railroad corporations paid 31 8/10 per cent., or ................................................................ The trust companies paid 12 2/10 per cent., or   ...................................................................... Life  and  fire  insurance  companies  and  other corporations, 17 2/10 per cent., or ..................................................................................... 117,568.09 I  believe  that  no  personal  property  in  the  State  pays  a  greater  tax  than  do  the  funds  of  savings  banks  and trust companies. No attempt is made at concealment and every dollar is taxed. SAVINGS BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES. It will be  seen by  the  report of  the  Inspector of Finance  that our  savings banks and  trust companies are  in a healthy  condition.  It  is  a  source  of  great  satisfaction  that  during  the  financial  panic  of  ’93,  which  caused  the suspension and  ruin of so many banking  institutions  in  the United States,  that not one of our savings banks and trust  companies  were  seriously  injured.  They  stood  the  test  completely,  which  may  be  attributed  to  the  wise laws by which they are governed, the integrity and wisdom of their managers, the wise counsel of the Inspector, and the common sense of a majority of the depositors. Although there was $1, 329,364 withdrawn from them in July and August, 1893, it has all been returned and with it $703,920.77 more, making on deposit, July 1st, 1894, $27, 966,855.46, with total resources of $30,512,449. I do not think it wise to make many, if any, changes in the law pertaining to these corporations. The interests of  the  people  seem  to  be well  guarded  and  permanency  in  laws  is  always  desirable.  I will  say  however,  that  it will be unwise and unprofitable to multiply savings banks and trust companies in the State. In most sections the ground is well covered now. 268,916.16 220,034.47  85,632.46  692,151,18 261,000.00 STATE AUDITOR’S REPORT I  invite  your  attention  to  the  comprehensive  report  of  the  State  Auditor.  It  discloses  to  whom  the  money which has been  raised by  taxation has been paid, and  it will be a help  to you  in correcting any abuses  that may exist. You will  notice  that Court  expenses  are  increasing  quite materially.  It will  be  your  duty  to  inquire  into  the reason of  these  increased  expenditures  and  ascertain whether  any  changes  in our  existing  laws  are necessary  to reduce them and still do justice to the Officers of the Court and other interested parties.  STATE PRISON AND HOUSE OF CORRECTION. The  report  of  the  Directors  of  the  State  Prison  and  House  of  Correction  shows  a  prosperous  financial condition of these institutions, During the last biennial term the Directors of the House of Correction have made quite extensive repairs and alterations in that institution, which were not contemplated at the close of the session of  the Legislature  of  ‘92. From  quite  a  thorough  examination which  I  have made  of  this  institution  I  am  of  the opinion that the directors were justified in making the alterations and additions they have, I do not well see how they  could  have  done  otherwise  under  the  circumstances.  The  institution  is  now  entirely  inadequate  for  the proper  custody  and  care  of  its  inmates. More  cell  room  is  imperatively  demanded.  The  number  of  inmates  has increased so materially  that  the cell room  is now but  little over one-half of what  is required. It  is  to be deplored that but little reformatory work is being done on account of the crowded condition of the institution. The  Directors  and  Superintendent  are  evidently  men  of  good  business  capacity  and  are  conducting  the institution upon business principles. REFORM SCHOOL The  report  of  the Trustees  and Superintendent of  the Reform School will  furnish  you  a  complete history of this  institution  for  the  last  biennial  term.  They  appear  to  have  discharged  their  duties  with  fidelity  and  ability. The school is doing a good conscientious work for the boys and girls committed to it, and the results are highly beneficial. The cost of maintenance is large, and may be thought unnecessarily so, but an inspection of the work being done and an examination of the expenditures do not disclose any extravagance. The value to the State and to  the  individual  in  bringing  many  of  these  boys  and  girls  into  respectable  citizenship  is  worth  the  cost  it involves.  The  State  Board  of  Health  has  condemned  the  system  of  sewerage  and  it  should  be  remodeled  to prevent unfavorable results. A great saving of fuel could be made by enlarging the boiler capacity of the heating apparatus. BRATTLEBORO RETREAT. The report of the Board of Supervisors of the Insane shows that the insane of the State are properly cared for both  in  the  Brattleboro  Retreat  and  the  Vermont  State  Asylum.  The  only  question  in  connection  with  the Brattleboro Retreat  is whether  the  price which  the  State  now  pays  for  the  care  of  the  insane  in  that  institution, should  not  be  decreased,  Considering  the  relation  the  State  bears  to  this  institution  and  its  present  strong financial, condition and  the material decrease  in cost of supplies,  it may be well for you  to  inquire  if  the cost  to the State cannot be equitably reduced. VERMONT ASYLUM FOR INSANE. I  recommend  to  your  careful  perusal  the  report  of  the  Trustees  and  Superintendent  of  this  institution.  This report  fully  sets  forth  its  condition  and,  needs.  I  think  that  it  would  be  wise  to  make  an  appropriation  of $100,000  for  the construction of a new wing and putting  in heating and  lighting apparatus and  furnishings. The benefits  to  be  derived  from  this  enlargement  are  great.  The  administration  building, which  includes  the  chapel and  kitchen  the  laundry,  the  steam  plant  and  electric  light  plant  are  sufficient  for  the  use  of  the  enlarged structure. It would accommodate two hundred more patients and, from the information I have obtained from the Superintendent,  I  estimate  that  the  cost  per week  per  person  of  keeping  these  two’  hundred  additional  patients would not exceed $1.75. This would be about $ 1.15 per week less than the cost of keeping the present patients. This is $2.00 per week per patient less than the State is paying the Brattleboro Retreat. This won1d make a total saving  of  $400  per  week  or  $20,800  per  annum  to  the  State  by  transferring  two  hundred  people  from  the Brattleboro  Retreat.  Should  you  think  it  wise  to  appropriate  all  that  the  Trustees  recommend,  all  the  patients could be moved from Brattleboro and the saving increased to $26,000 or more per annum. This  appropriation  would  require  a  tax  of  about  six  cents  or  three  cents  each  year  for  this  biennial  term.  I believe  it  would  be  true  economy,  as  well  as  humanity,  to  do  the  work.  Although  we  could  hire  the money  at about  3 ¼ per cent., I cannot advise doing so, believing we are able to pay as we go. The Trustees and Superintendent are performing their duties ably and faithfully.  STATE BOARD OF HEALTH. . . The  report  of  this  Board  indicates  that  it  has  done  a  large  amount  of  important  work  during  the  last  two years, which should be continued. RAILROADS. The  able  and  interesting  report  of  the Railroad Commissioners  shows  among  other  things  that  the  physical condition  of  the  railroads  in  this  State  is  excellent  in  the main. The  railroads  have  suffered  severely  during  the past eighteen months on account of the general depression in the business of the country, and it is much to their credit that they have not materially lessened their service to the public during these trying times. Railroad  corporations  are  the  creation  of  the  State  and  properly  may  be  supervised  by  it,  but  they  are intimately  connected with  our  business  prosperity  and  are  necessary  for  our  convenience,  and,  so  long  as  they properly perform  their duty  to  the people,  should be  looked upon with  favor. When  they do not  they  should be corrected and controlled. FISH AND GAME. I  invite  your  attention  to  the  comprehensive  report  of  the  Commissioners  of  Fisheries  and  Game  for  a detailed account of their work and its needs. The establishment of a Fish Hatchery by the State as well as one by the  United  States,  coupled  with  the  energetic  efforts  of  the  Commissioners  of  Fisheries  and  Game,  and  of  the Fish  and  Game  League,  have  excited  an  interest  is  not  confined  to  this  State.  I  am  confident  that  in  the  near future  the  results  of  their  work  will  he  of  great  financial  value  to  us.  Good  hunting  and  fishing  are  great attractions  for  people  in  the  large  cities  and  are  appreciated  by  many  of  o  own  citizens.  I  believe  this  work deserves encouragement within reasonable limits. SOLDIER’S HOME. This  institution  is  a  monument  to  the  patriotic  generosity  of  the  people  of  Vermont.  From  1861  until  the present time the people of this State have never been found wanting in generosity to those who risked their lives in defense of the Union and for the honor of Vermont. This institution is in fact a “Home” for veterans who are without homes elsewhere. The expenditures are necessarily quite  large, but are not extravagant, and are closely scrutinized  by  the  competent  and  faithful  President  and  other  members  of  the  Board  of  Trustees,  who  serve without  compensation.  For  a  detailed  account  of  this  institution  and  its  future  requirements  I  refer  you  to  the report of the Trustees which will soon be placed, before you. NATIONAL GUARD. Our  regiment  of  Militia  and  Light  Battery,  or  National  Guard  as  it  is  called,  exists  by  virtue  of  the requirements  of  our  Constitution.  The  report  of  the  Adjutant  and  Inspector-General,  and  the  very  able  and comprehensive report of Captain H. E. Tutherly, U. S. A., to the War Department, show that the National Guard is  in  excellent  condition.  It  is well officered  and deserves your  favor. Every member of  it  is  rendering patriotic service  and  practically  without  compensation,  I  commend  to  your  consideration  the  recommendations  of  the Adjutant-General  that  a  permanent  camp  be  established  near  Fort  Ethan  Allen  This  would  be  an  economical measure,  and  it  seems  to  me  give  conducive  to  the  efficiency  of  the  National  Guard,  which  is  the  paramount object  to  be  borne  in  mind.  If  it  can  be  done,  I  advise  that  existing  laws  be  changed  so  that  my  successors  in office will have  the privilege of  appointing  the Adjutant and  Inspector-General,  the Quartermaster-General and the  Judge-Advocate-General.  The  Governor  is  commander-in-chief  of  the  forces  of  the  State,  and  should  have the privilege of appointing all of his staff officers. This is the method adopted in many, if not all other States. Since  the  last  biennial  session  the  United  States  Government  has  established  a  Military  Post  upon  land ceded  to  them  by  this  State,  near Winooski  and  Essex  Junction.  This  establishment will  be  of much  benefit  to our  State  in  many  ways.  The  location  of  this  post,  called  Fort  Ethan  Allen,  in  Vermont,  was  obtained  largely through the efforts of Senator Redfield Proctor.   EDUCATION. Education  is  the basis of  the morality, happiness and prosperity of a people, and consequently  is of  the  first importance  to  the  State. While  the  present  school  law  may  need  some  amendments,  the  consensus  of  opinion seems to be that it is the best law we have had, and the best adapted to this age. I think it should have a thorough trial  before  its  essential  features  are  changed  The  normal  schools  appear  to  be  doing  their  work  in  the  usual satisfactory manner, though I think it would be very desirable and much less expensive if we had but one school of the proper proportions. The report of the State Superintendent indicates activity and honest effort in his work. OUR COLLEGES. The  University  of  Vermont  and  State  Agricultural  College  is  constantly  increasing  its  advantages  for students of all classes, and the educational and agricultural interests of the State are being more benefited by its work  than  ever  before.  The  influence  of  the  agricultural  department  is  being manifested  in many  lines.  I  think the time has passed for severe criticisms as to its usefulness. The Norwich University and Middlebury College are both extending their spheres of usefulness. All of these institutions deserve your continued favor. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. The Board of Agriculture and the Dairymen’s Association are each performing a good work in their spheres, The benefits of  these organizations are manifested by  the  increased value of  the products of agriculture and  the dairy, and are deserving of continued moral and financial support. THE MARY FLETCHER HOSPITAL. This  institution,  located  in  Burlington,  is  doing  a  most  beneficent  and  great  work  for  suffering  humanity. The  report of  the Trustees which will be placed before you  shows  that  they  treated 664 patients during  the  last year, of which 6 per cent were charity patients,  reckoned by  the  length of  time  they were  in  the  institution. The paying patients, however, did not pay the cost of their care into $2.65 per week, each. The whole income of this institution is dedicated to the relief of suffering humanity, and it is managed by able and benevolent men. FIRE MARSHAL. Insurance  men  of  this  State  desire  the  office  of  Fire  Marshal  to  be  created,  whose  duty  it  shall  be  to investigate  the  causes  of  fire  so  that  punishment  may  be  meted  out  to  incendiaries.  They  claim  where  this method  has  been  adopted  in  other  States  losses  by  fire  have  been  materially  decreased.  This  result  would  not only  benefit  the  insurance  companies  but  every  person  who  insures  property,  as  the  cost  of  insurance  is  based upon  former  losses.  The  expenses  of  this  office,  if  created,  should,  I  think,  be  borne  largely  or  entirely  by  the insurance companies. THE AUSTRALIAN BALLOT. Considerable  dissatisfaction  is  being  manifested  at  the  working  of  this  system  of  voting.  It  is  claimed  by many  of  our  citizens  that  the  system  is  too  elaborate  and  expensive  and  quite  unnecessary  for  such  a  State  as Vermont. There is a manifest disinclination upon the part of quite a large per cent, of voters to be subject to the requirements of  this  system of voting. From  representations made  to me  I am  inclined  to believe  that  from  five to ten per cent, of the voters of the State are practically disfranchised by reason of their disinclination to submit to  such  an  elaborate  system.  I  think  that  no  one,  however  intelligent,  goes  into  a  booth  to  vote  without experiencing some trepidation for fear that he will make a mistake. I  recommend  that  you  investigate  these  causes  of  complaint  and  decide whether  the  law  should  not  be  less modified. I will only bring  to your attention one out of many of  the modifications of  the  law proposed  to me. It is suggested  that ballots be prepared as now, but detached  from each other  leaving off  the square at  the  top and placed  in  the booth. The voter could  then go  into a booth and select and use  the ballot as prepared, or prepare a ballot  to  suit  him;  he  could  erase  names  from  the  ballot  as  prepared  and  insert  other  names  if  he  chose. Inspectors  could  see  that  only  one  ballot  of  each  kind was  deposited  and  the  secrecy  of  the  ballot  and  freedom of the voter would not be destroyed. OUR FORESTS. The owners of timber lands in our State are pursuing a ruinous policy in the method used in harvesting their timber,  There  is  no  more  valuable  crop  produced  from  land  than  timber,  especially  spruce  timber.  By  the preservation  of  spruce  trees  of  ten  inches  in  diameter  and  under, when  the  large  timber  is  cut,  a  good  crop  can be cut every  fifteen years, at  least. Every decade will  see  timber more valuable, and  it  is of great  importance  to the  owners  of  timber  lands,  as  well  as  to  the  State  as  a  whole—  for  what  increases  the  wealth  of  a  class increases the wealth of the State some measure should be adopted to lessen the wanton destruction of our forest. The value of our water powers and  the attractiveness of our scenery and preservation of game and fish also call for reform I invite your earnest attention to this subject. GOOD ROADS. I  thoroughly  believe  in  good  roads.  They  are  necessary  for  the  comfort  and  profit  of  our  citizens,  and  as  a means to attract to us people from other States. I do not feel sure that the five per cent. State tax has been wisely expended. In most towns it has been put to the same uses as the town highway tax, and in many cases the towns have  raised  five  per  cent,  less  tax  than  they  would  had  they  not  received  the  State  tax.  Many  believe  that  the distribution of the tax is unjust and think that each county should have the benefit of the tax levied upon it. There  does  not  seem  to  be  any  good  reason  why  a  county  in  one  part  of  the  State  should  send  several thousand  dollars  per  annum  into  a  county  in  another  part.  If  the  county  plan  of  distribution  were  adopted  the money  raised should be expended,  in my opinion,  in what would be called permanent  improvements, under  the directions  of  a  Commission  composed  of  say  one  from  each  town  in  the  county.  Addison,  Bennington, Caledonia,  Franklin  and Washington Counties would  not  be materially  affected  by  the  change. Chittenden  and Rutland  Counties  would  be  bene6ted,  while  Essex.  Lamoille,  Grand  Isle,  Orange,  Orleans,  Windsor  and Windham would suffer loss.  Each county  is particularly  interested  in good  roads  in  its own county, but only  interested  in a general way in the roads of other counties. The large towns in the several counties are interested in having good roads in the small  to  as  the  trade  and  traffic  of  small  towns  are  tributary  to  them  and  therefore  they  might  in  justice  be required  to bear a share of  the burden of maintenance of  their  roads.  If any change  in  the distribution of  the  tax is made it should be done solely because you believe it to be just. THE PROHIBITORY LAW. For  forty-two  years  this  law  has  been  one  of  the  most  important  in  our  Statutes.  It  may  not  have accomplished  all  that  its  friends  hoped,  but  that  it  has  been  a  powerful  instrument  for  the  prevention  of intemperance  and  crime  during  these  years  but  few  people will  deny. The  administration  of  the  law,  especially in  larger  towns,  has  been  severely  criticized  of  late,  and  it  must  be  confessed  that  the  criticisms  are  largely justified. The  friends of  the  law cannot afford  to make  light of  these criticisms;  they should  frankly admit  them and endeavor to correct the abuses specified. The law itself is not weak, in thatit  is  not  severe  enough.  If  I  were to recommend any change it would not be toward greater severity or more restrictions.  It  is  absolutely  necessary  that  there  should  be  a  friendly  public  sentiment  to  ensure  the  enforcement  of  this or any law. Too great  severity  tends  to  create  adverse  sentiment. There  is,  however,  no  doubt,  that  the  sentiment  of  the people  of  this  State  is  strongly  in  favor  of  the  present  law  and  its  honest  enforcement.  If  it  is  ever modified  or repealed  it  will  be  done  by  temperance  men  and  in  the  interest  of  temperance.  Some  people,  especially  those living  in  larger  towns,  seem  to  be  discouraged  because  the  law  does  not  absolutely  prohibit,  but  they  should bear  in  mind  that  no  law  against  the  commission  of  crime  prohibits,  but  only  restricts  in  proportion  to  its enforcement. The prohibitory law is a stringent, restrictive measure. In some other States some other restrictive  laws may be  better;  but  for  our  State  the  present  law  is  unquestionably  the  best  at  this  time.  According  to  the  Audit office’s  report  the amount of  fines and costs paid during  the  last  two years on, account of violations of  the  law, exceeded the Court expenses incurred in enforcing it by $25,000 per annum. REVISED LAWS. One of  the most  important matters  that you will be  called upon  to  consider, will be  the  revision of  the  laws of  the  State.  A  commission,  composed  of  three  eminent  lawyers  appointed  under  the  act  of  1892,  have  spent several months in the work assigned to them, and will present their report for your action. This work of revision will be one of the most important and laborious of the session, and should be commenced at the earliest possible moment.  The  committee  having  it  in  charge  should,  in  my  opinion,  have  no  other  work  to  do  so  that  it  may report  to  you  in  a  reasonable  time.  The  utmost  energy will  have  to  be  used  in  this work  or  the  session will  be prolonged and expensive. THOMAS CHITTENDEN. In  the  little  church-yard  in  the  town  of Williston,  lie  the  remains of one of  the  fathers of Vermont, Thomas Chittenden. To no one man are we more indebted for the independence and formation of this State, than to him. He has been aptly called the George Washington of Vermont—the father of Vermont. As the first Governor for nineteen  years  he  safely  guided  the  affairs  of  State,  and,  with  the  Allens  and  others,  by  his  wise  counsel  and statesmanship  compelled  recognition  by  Congress  and  gained  for  Vermont  an  enviable  standing  among  the sister hood of States. It seems to me that it would he a very proper thing for this State to recognize his services and perpetuate his memory by erecting over his grave a simple but suitable shaft. A Mr. Root, formerly a resident of Williston, has recently  purchased  a  half-acre  of  land  suitably  located  for  the  erection  of  the  monument,  and  presented  it  for such use, I sincerely hope you will give this subject proper consideration. VERMONT. It is impossible at this time to predict with accuracy the effect the recent tariff legislation will have upon the prosperity  of  our  people,  but  with  free  wool  and  lumber  and  a  material  reduction  of  duty  upon  many  of  our leading  products,  no  one  can  feel  otherwise  than  apprehensive.  I  do  not wish,  however,  to  take  a  gloomy  view of the situation, but believe in laying in a good store of courage and hope and faith in the future of the Republic and  in  the  resources  of Vermont. There  is no better place  for  a Vermonter  to  invest money  than  in Vermont.  If all our people for the next ten years would do what they have not done in the past ten years, invest their surplus earnings at home, Vermont would teem with new industries and our population and prosperity would materially increase. I predict  that a substantial gain  in our population will be shown by  the next census. The western fever is abating. Few  if any States  in  the union  surpass ours  in value per acre of  the products of  the  soil, and none of equal  size  surpass  us  in  value  of  quarries,  in  value  and  availability  of  water  power,  and  none  in  beauty  and variety  of  scenery,  in  purity  of  politics,  in  healthfulness  of  climate,  in  happiness  of  homes,  in  morality  of people, in bravery of men and virtue of women. Being thus happily situated, why should not we be content. The  times  admonish  us  to  be  very  careful,  though  not  parsimonious,  in  appropriations  of  money  for  the needs of the State. The  proper  conduct  of  public  affairs  and  the  progress  of  improvement  which  will  increase  the  value  of property in the State, cannot be done without the use of money, but it should be wisely expended for the good of all people and not for any particular person or class of persons. Too much  legislation  is not wise.  It  is better  to do  too  little  than  too much. As a  rule,  laws  should have age before  they  are  changed,  so  that  their  true  value  may  be  ascertained. With  a  firm  reliance  upon  Divine  favor, without  which  we  cannot  hope  to  accomplish  anything  of  permanent  value  to  our  beloved  State,  let  us  enter vigorously upon the work of the Session.
