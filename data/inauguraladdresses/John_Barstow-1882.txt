Inaugural address of  John L. Barstow  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  Joint Assembly  Biennial Session  1882  Thursday, October 5, 1882 Inaugural Address Gentlemen of the Senate and   House of Representatives:   It  is  one  hundred  and  five  years  since  our  fathers, while  surrounded with  dangers  and  enemies,  established the  “Constitution  of  this  Commonwealth,”  under  and  by  the  provisions  of  which  successive  legislatures  have met  without  let  or  hinderance  and  in  pursuance  of  whose  provisions  we  have  now  assembled  as  the  “trustees and  servants”  of  the  people  to  execute  certain  requirements  of  existing  statutes,  and  to  enact  “such  laws  as  are necessary  for  the  good  government  of  the  State.”    Having  sworn  to  support  this  Constitution,  let  us  give  our attention  to  the  important  duties  of  our  trust with  the  same  scrupulous  care  and  fidelity  that we would  exercise in  the management of  a private  estate  committed  to our  charge,  and bring  them  to  a  close  at  such  early  time  as the interest of the State will permit. We  meet  under  most  favorable  circumstances.    General  health  and  peace,  bountiful  harvests,  fair  business prosperity,  ample demand  and  reward  for  labor,  absence of debt,  faithful  and  zealous State officers,  are  among the blessings that crown the close of the past bi-ennial term.  Our first thought should be thankfully to recognize these and all other favors of Divine Providence, and devoutly to supplicate their continuance. Yet  our  congratulations  at  this  time  are  clouded  by  the  remembrance  that  within  the  present  year  we  have lost  two of our most distinguished  and highly honored  citizens.   The death of  John Pierpoint, who  for  so many years adorned the highest judicial office in our State and of the eminent scholar and diplomat, George P. Marsh, who  has  filled many  positions  of  responsibility  in  this Commonwealth  and Nation,  is  cause  of  deepest  sorrow.  Not  since  the  death  of  Senators  Foot  and  Collamer  have  we  been  called  to  mourn  the  loss  of  men  who  have rendered the State such distinguished service. The Governor  is directed by  the Constitution  to prepare and  lay before  the General Assembly such business as may  appear  to him necessary, but under our bi-ennial, one  term  system,  the newly-elected  executive has but slight opportunity to become acquainted with the needs of the state either by an examination of the reports of its officers  for  the  previous  fiscal  year,  or  by  any  official  knowledge  of  the  operation  of  the  laws.    This disadvantage  is,  however,  greatly  obviated  by  the  custom  on  the  part  of  retiring  Governors  of  sending  to  the Legislature a farewell message.  They have deemed it proper in each case to offer an excuse for so doing, but its benefits are so obvious that I suggest it be made a duty. Some of the reports of State officers I have not seen; others were furnished in manuscript at a late day; while a  few  were  seasonably  prepared  and  forwarded.    They  will  all  be  laid  before  you.    A  careful  study  of  these documents from men most familiar with the affairs and wants of the State is indispensable to proper legislation.  I  am  confident  that  this  has  been  very much  neglected,  and  I  earnestly  invite your  attention  to  them,  as well  as to  those  of  previous  years,  and  to  the  reports  of  legislative  committees  found  in  the  various  journals,  all  of which are of great interest and value. FINANCES. The financial condition of the state, as shown by the Treasurer’s report, is as follows” LIABILITIES Due towns, U.S. Surplus fund ................................................................................................    “   soldiers’ account.............................................................................................................    “   suspense      “     (outstanding checks)............................................................................    “   bonds and coupons, due 1876 ........................................................................................    “   towns on account savings bank tax ................................................................................    “   agricultural college fund, due 1890 ................................................................................    “   orders not presented .......................................................................................................   $13,397.62 8,959.02 1,940.24 4,360.00 42,760.36 135,500.00 2,666.55 ------------- $209,583.79 ASSETS.

It  is a  fertile  source of  extravagance  in  the National  as well  as State Government, and an unnecessary  burden  on  the  people.    Authority  being  given  to  the  Treasurer  to  negotiate  temporary  loans,  no embarrassment  will  ensue.    The  temporary  loans  made  by  the  Treasurer  in  1882  were  $83,500,  of  which $56,500  was  under  authority  of  the  act  of  1880,  and  the  remainder  under  previous  acts.    These  previous  acts, running  back  to  1865,  are  regarded  by  the  Treasurer  as  still  in  force,  and  under  them  there  is  still  authority  to borrow  over  one  million  dollars.  I  recommend  the  repeal  of  all  such  authority,  including  the  act  of  1880,  and that  future  acts  should  provide  that  the  power  of  the Treasurer  to  borrow money  should  cease  at  the  end  of  the succeeding session. STATE EXPENSES. The  disbursements  for  the  last  two  years  are  presented  by  the  Treasurer  in  his  usual  clear  and  careful manner.    Omitting  all  payments  on  account  of  loans,  savings  banks,  tax,  United  States  deposit,  soldiers’  and trust  funds,  that  are  not  taken  into  account  as  a  part  of  the  current  expenses  of  the  State,  the  disbursements  for the two years ending August 1, 1882, were ...........................................................................  $719,171.00 773,911.00 1880, were ............................................................................  “                          “ “                          “ 1878, were ............................................................................ 824,572.00 810,858.00 1876, were ............................................................................ “                          “ 1874, were ............................................................................ “                          “ 697,638.00 “                          “ 1862,  (omitting  all  war  expenses,  also )   were ............................................................................ 364,772.00 The Auditor estimates that $70,000 of the expenses of 1881 and 1882 were exceptional.  Admitting this, and deducting but $16,000 as exceptional  from expenses of 1861 and 1862, during which  time  two  regular and one extra  sessions  were  held,  we  find  our  annual  current  expenses  $150,000  greater  than  twenty  years  since,  and they were much  larger at  that  time  than  they should have been.   A system of  the same petty  frauds existed  then that have been  so often  reported of  late years.    I  am  aware  that  this  statement will  surprise many,  for nearly  all the  tables prepared on  this subject  refer  to 1860 and 1861  for comparison, and  these years are generally spoken of as a halcyon period “before the war,” but the Auditor for 1860, in his report, devotes some space to “deficits” and  “frauds”  In  the  treasury;  to  “errors  and  irregularities”  of  county  clerks;  and  as  to  accounts  of  State’s attorneys,  he  says  “  I  find  in most  of  them  improper  times  charged  and  allowed,”  by  court  auditors,  “and  it  is believed that considerable amounts of money will be found in the hands of some of them unaccounted for.”  He also treats of sheriffs in about the same manner, so that if we seek to find a time when State expenses were what they should be, we must go back of 1860.  But with all these practices in vogue, the court expenses for that year were $75,642, against $178,027 in 1878. The whole subject of Court and State expenses has been so freely discussed by  the press, so much attention was  devoted  to  it  in  the  messages  of  Governors  Fairbanks  and  Proctor,  and  in  able  reports  by  Hon.  Samuel Williams,  a  chairman  of  a  joint  special  committee  in  1876,  and  by  Judge  Veazey,  who,  as  a  commissioner  on this  subject,  appointed  in  1878, made  a  full,  clear,  and  valuable  report  to  the Legislature  in  1880,  that  it  seems needless  to  do  more  than  ask  your  attention  to  the  matter.    I  would  suggest  that  every  thing  bearing  on  the subject  of  expenses,  in  the  documents  referred  to,  be  reprinted  for  your  information,  and  that  the recommendations  of  Judge  Veazey  be  carried  into  effect.    Among  them  are  the  increase  of  jury  fees,  the limitation  of  the  number  of  trial  justices,  and  the  power  of  the  State’s  Attorney  to  prosecute  all  crimes  by information.   When a man of Judge Veazey’s high character and ability devotes  time  to a matter with which he is  already  familiar  and  suggest  measures  that  will  reduce  taxation,  and  root  out  long  established  evils,  his suggestions should not find a tomb in the hands of a committee. The  re-publication  of  these  reports  is  desirable  for  the  reason  that  it  is  almost  impossible  to  arrive  at  any correct  result  or  conclusion  from  reading  the  State  reports  of  that  period.   Mr. Williams  says;  “With  this  view, we  recommend  the  adoption  of  the  joint  resolution  herewith  submitted,  so  that  the  report  of  the  Auditor  of Accounts may hereafter exhibit a more comprehensive and detailed summary of  the  receipts and disbursements of the State revenue  .    .    .    .   The later reports are such as not only to require days of labor, but uncertainty as to the  correctness  of  the  result,  unless  the  vouchers  are  examined  in  detail.    In  order  to  ascertain  in  regard  to  the receipts  and  disbursements,  you  must  collate  and  compare  the  reports  of  the  Treasurer,  Auditor  of  Accounts, and  county  clerks,  examine  the  vouchers  and  classify  the  items,  and  be  very  careful  to  add  or  deduct  from  the expenses of the different departments items which appear in others.  The classification in the Auditor’s report is very  defective,  so  that  if,  for  example,  it  should  be  desirable  to  ascertain  the  costs  of  the  Board  of  Insurance Commissioners, it would be necessary to examine all the vouchers in detail, as some items are found in ‘official expenses,’  some  in  ‘printing  reports,’  and  some  in  ‘miscellaneous,’  and  the  same  remarks will  apply  in  respect to  “other  expenses.”    This  difficulty may  be  further  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  the  court  expenses  for  1878  are given  differently  in  official  documents,  the  lowest  statement  of  them  being  $110,549,  while  Judge  Veazey’s correct analysis shows them to have been $178,027. The classification in the later reports of State expenses has been much improved, but if we look for the items of which a certain class of expenses  is made up, we still  find  it a work of great difficulty.    I venture  to suggest, as  an  addition  to  the  present  system  of  classification,  that  the Auditor  be  required  to  append  to  each  heading  a list of all orders drawn under it, and that any order embraced under more than one head should be so designated.  It  will  tend  to  diminish  taxation  if  such  light  is  thrown  upon  our  expenditures  that  both  legislators  and  people can, without the aid of an expert, ascertain exactly for what purpose and to whom their money is paid. It  is  evident  from  the Auditor’s  report  and  from  the  documents  before  referred  to  that  some  claims  for  fees and  expenses  are  paid  under  the  head  of  court  expenses  that  are  not  specifically  authorized  by  law.    There  is also another class of accounts which have partly grown out of legislation during the war, when the Auditor was necessarily vested with great discretionary power, that are paid without specific authority of law, some of which are  classified  among  official  expenses.    The  amount  of  these  claims  will  vary  with  different  auditors  and different  officers.    I  am  of  the  opinion  that  section  219  of  the  Revised  Laws  should  be  repealed,  and  that  no State  officers  should  be  allowed  to  approve,  pay  or  draw  orders  for  any  purpose  not  specifically  authorized  by law.  If any hardship arises under such a restriction, it will soon come to light, and can be provided for.  I regard the  saving  of  money  to  the  people,  important  as  that  may  be,  as  of  less  consequence  than  is  the  adoption  of  a system which will put  a  stop  to  improper  and  illegal  expenditures based on  custom,  and which diminish with  a faithful auditor, and when public attention is directed to them, but increase again under different circumstances.  We should not only remove abuses, but prevent their recurrence. In  regard  to  the  whole  subject  of  State  expenses,  I may  observe  that  they  are made  up  of  small  items,  and each one must be carefully scrutinized, or the aggregate is large.  The largest single item is the debentures of the General  Assembly.    By  resolutely  refusing  to  act  on  private  bills,  the  object  of  which  can  be  accomplished under  the  provisions  of  the  general  laws,  by  refusing  to  adjourn  unnecessarily,  refusing  to  consider  bills  not introduced  early  in  the  session, by  refusing  to pass  any bill not  shown  to be actually beneficial and needful, by observing  the  clause  of  the Constitution which  enjoins  that  “previous  to  any  law  being made  to  raise  a  tax,  the purpose  for  which  it  is  to  be  raised  ought  to  appear  evident  to  the  Legislature  to  be  of  more  service  to  the community  than  the  money  would  be  if  not  collected,”  you  will  earn  the  gratitude  of  your  constituents  and lessen their  burdens.   $28,583 45,007 66,576 It  is gratifying  to know  that a considerable reduction has been made  in the State expenses since 1878, when they  reached  their highest point.   This  is  owing  to  several  causes, not  the  least of which  is  the  faithful,  fearless performance of duty by the present Auditor. The total expenses for the year ending July 31,1878, were .....................................................................................................  $178,027.00 156,287.00 1879, do. do.   do. do. 1880, 150,849.00 123,765.00 1881, do. do.   do. do. 1882, 120,687.00 While  the  reduction  in court expenses, as  shown by  the  foregoing  table,  is worthy of note,  it  should also be observed  as  equally  deserving  of  attention,  that  there  has  been  a  large  increase  in  the  amount  of  fees  and  costs collected, as appears by the following table: Fines  and  costs  collected  for  the  term  ending July  31, 1878,  1880, do. do. do. do. 1882, SCHOOLS. In  our  colleges,  normal,  high  and  graded  schools,  we  have  a  corps  of  teachers  to  whom  we  owe  a  debt  of gratitude.    They  have  grown  gray  in  the  performance  of  ill-requited  labor  for  the  common  good.    Their  duties are the most arduous, as they are the most noble and dignified of all secular professions.  Thoroughly devoted to their work of the higher grade, they have never failed to recognize the supreme and commanding importance of the  common  schools,  and have  ever been  ready  to do  labor  for  their  improvement.   One of  these  is our present Superintendent of Education, who  enjoys  and deserves  the confidence of all  that know him, yet  I  regret  that he has  not,  associated  with  him,  a  board  of  these  veteran  teachers,  for  official  advice  and  counsel.    It  is  thought, however,  by  many  of  our  oldest  and  most  experienced  teachers,  that  the  popular  distrust  of  this  method  of official  supervision,  which  was  occasioned  by  the  employment  of  a  secretary  who  had  a  pecuniary  interest  in the enforcement of the law requiring uniformity to text books, has not sufficiently subsided to justify a return to it.    It was  this  that  caused  the  “extinction of  the board  and  the  creation of  supervision  resting  solely  in  a  single person,”  and  it  gave  the  cause  of  popular  education  in  Vermont  a  blow  from  which  it  has  not  yet  recovered.  The  board,  with  its  secretary,  was  abolished  by  the  Legislature  by  an  almost  unanimous  vote  in  1874,  but  its books  remained  until,  by  another  step  backward  in  1878,  the  uniformity  of  text  books was  destroyed  by  an  act allowing  each  town  to  select  its  own  books.    The  obnoxious  arithmetic  then  left  Vermont,  only  two  towns voting to retain it, while one hundred and eighty-six towns went back to the “obsolete” arithmetic of 1867. The  act  of  1878,  creating  as  many  “Boards”  as  there  are  towns,  providing  over  seven  hundred  persons, instead of six, “to prevent  the  too  frequent change of  text books  in common schools,” was not as destructive of uniformity as might have been expected.  The resolute good sense of teachers and town superintendents secured to  some  counties  absolute  uniformity,  but  where  this  was  not  the  case,  the  result  has  been  deplorable.    Before the  meeting  of  the  next  Legislature,  two  hundred  and  forty  other  boards  will  be  elected  to  create  further diversity,  unless  your  wisdom  interposes  and  provides  some  other  course.    I  respectfully  suggest,  as  most economical  and  conservative,  that  the  Superintendent  be  directed  to  select  a  list  from  the  books  now  in  use  in the  largest  number  of  towns;  that  towns  be  allowed  to  continue  using  books  now  adopted;  but  that  in  case  a change  is made by any  town  in 1884, as provided by  law,  it  shall be  to  the  list prepared by  the Superintendent.  Thus will a majority vote of all  the  towns decide what  the  list  shall be, and we  shall gradually  return  to  the old system. I  should,  however,  desire  to  change  some  of  the  readers  in  use  by  our  schools.    Emphasis  and  inflection, pitch  and  modulation,  can  be  taught  as  well  from  the  orations  of  Patrick  Henry  and  Daniel Webster,  from  the writings of Andrew Jackson and Charles Sumner, from the patriotic poetry of Whittier, Holmes, Bryant, Lowell and Drake,  as  from  the works of DeFoe  or  the plays of Shakespeare, while  from  the  daily  drill  in  reading  such lessons of freedom, nationality and patriotism, there will be taught that love and duty toward the country and its flag, which, when occasion arises, will present a race of patriots as devoted to liberty, and as ready to defend it, as were our fathers of the Revolution and those who succeeded them in more recent contests. The following table from the report of Mr. Conant, the Superintendent in 1880, gives some interesting facts: 1880 1870 1860  1850 2,359 2,480 2,591 Number of school districts ......................................2,594 Number of children in the schools ........................99,110 75,691 75,026 75,238 Number of teachers ................................................ 4,359 4,796 5,009 Average wages per week, including  $5.53 $6.06 $3.72 board, of teachers ............................................$3.15 Entire expenditures by districts and towns for schools, 1850, $217,402.33; 1860 $334,932.00; 1870, $543,627.28; 1880, $446, 216.90. The cost here given does not include that of books, which, when no changes are made, are estimated to cost $125,000 per year.  In the confusion incident to frequent changes of law and supervision, the price of books has greatly  increased,  and most  of  them  are  of  such  poor  quality  in paper  and binding  as  to need  frequent  renewal.  Radical  legislation  can  change  this  and  effect  a  saving  to  the  people  of  one-half  the  present  cost  of  books,  and this saving could be applied to obtaining a better grade of teachers, which is our present great need. It  is worthy  of  your  consideration  that  for  twenty  years  nearly  all  our  official  school  boards  have  urged  the adoption of the town system, and greater assistance to Normal Schools.  Some difference of opinion exists as to whether we  should have  a greater or  less number of Normal Schools.   Those we have are under most excellent management,  and  are  doing  great  good.    In  every  department  of  education  I  trust  you  will  exercise  a  wise liberality.    The  Superintendent  should  have  sufficient  funds  to  continue  his  meetings,  and  in  greater  number.  The people understand their duty, but need to be continually reminded of it.  These meetings tend to infuse life, create interest, enlarge ideas, and increase the zeal of all who attend them. A  request  has been  sent  to me  from  a highly  respectable  source  that  I  should  ask your  attention  to  the half-day system of schools. The  public  library  is  the  most  valuable  adjunct  of  the  public  school.    No  greater  aid  can  be  given  to  the cause  of  education  than  by  affording  to  the  pupils  in  our  schools  free  access  to  large  and  carefully  chosen collections  of  books.    It  is  gratifying  to  note  that  the  number  of  public  libraries  in  our  State  is  increasing  each year. UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT AND STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. The  act  of  Congress  of  July  2,  1862,  which  gave  to  Vermont  the  fund  of  which  the  income  goes  to  this institution,  provides  that  this  income  shall  be  used  for  the  support  of  at  least  one  college  “where  the  leading object  shall  be, without  excluding  other  scientific  and  classical  studies,  and  including military  tactics,  to  teach such  branches  of  learning  as  are  regulated  to  agriculture  and  the  mechanic  arts,  in  such  manner  as  the Legislatures may  respectively prescribe,  in order  to promote  the  liberal and practical education of  the  industrial classes  in  the  several  pursuits  and  professions  in  life.”    November  9,  1865,  the  Legislature  passed  an  act constituting  the  present  institution,  and  provided  that  the  course  of  study  should  be  such  “as  shall  render  the whole  instruction  in  conformity  with  said  act  of  Congress.”  In  the  succeeding  February  the  trustees,  in accordance  with  law,  established  a  professorship  of  modern  languages,  a  professorship  of  chemistry  and  its application  to  agriculture,  analysis  of  soils,  relations  of  soil  to  vegetable  production,  botany,  forestry,  habits  of domestic animals, insects injurious to vegetation, and also civil engineering.  Professional instructors of military tactics  have  also  been  provided,  and  special  winter  courses  of  lectures  have  been  introduced  on  agricultural chemistry, botany, physics, entomology,  stockbreeding, dairying,  fruit culture,  road-making,  farm accounts and bee  culture,  and  these  courses  will  be  renewed  and  extended  as  they  are  called  for.    The  trustees  and  officers have been constant and indefatigable in their efforts to comply with the law in letter and spirit. At the time of its charter it was an experiment, and many leading men through the State had great fears as to its success, and would have preferred a separate institution.  I have conferred with many of them during the past summer, and  find  that  they are now  satisfied  that  the course  taken was a wise and  judicious one, and  its  results most  beneficial,  their  only  regret  being  the  limited  number  of  students  who  have  availed  themselves  of  its privileges.    Legislative  committees  have  been  appointed  to  investigate  its  progress  and management,  and  have found and  reported  that  the  trustees and managers have  studiously aimed and  faithfully  labored  to comply with their  charters,  and  to  meet,  so  far  as  their  means  would  allow,  all  the  demands  for  instruction  that  have  been made  upon  them,  and  that more  than  the  increase  derived  from  the United  States  fund  is  annually  expended  in paying  the  expenses  of  the  industrial  department.    The  President  and  Professors  are  always  in  readiness  to respond to calls for public addresses from lyceums, literary, agricultural, and other associations, and in this way do a vast amount of good, and it is to be noted that they uniformly and pointedly enforce the idea of the dignity and nobility of labor. Some  persons  favor  an  experimental  farm  to  be  used  in  connection  with  the  college,  and  thoughtlessly reflect  on  the  trustees  for  not  providing  one.    The  United  States  law  provides  that  not  over  ten  percent  of  the fund may  be  expended  for  land,  and  that  on  no  “pretence whatever”  shall  any  part  of  the  fund  be  used  for  the “erection,  preservation,  or  repair”  of  any  building.   When  the  State  is  ready  to  erect  the  buildings  and  assume their  preservation,  we  shall  doubtless  find  the  trustees  ready  to  provide  the  land  and  tutors.    Experimental farming had its origin in Prussia thirty years since, and has rapidly extended until there are now many stations in Prussia,  France,  England,  and  our  own  country.    They  are  to  be  found  in  our  own  latitude  and  climate  in neighboring States.   Everything  of  value  in  the  results  of  this  experimental  framing  is  published  in  agricultural papers,  and  is  easily  and  cheaply  accessible  to  all.    Such  work  in  Vermont  would  be  largely  duplicate.    Every State  that  accepted  the  government  fund  has  largely  aided  its  agricultural  college,  in  some  cases  to  the  amount of  millions.    Vermont  has  not  yet  expended  a  cent.    The  institution  has  always  kept  out  of  debt,  and  its management has  inspired such confidence  that private beneficence  is being  largely extended  to  it.   Through  the liberality of Mr.  John P. Howard,  the old  edifice  is now being greatly  enlarged  and  almost  entirely  rebuilt,  and the announcement of Mr. Billings’ generous gift to the University has just been made public. It has an extensive library, art gallery, laboratory, and a highly successful medical department. I  respectfully  suggest  that  you  take  into  consideration  the  propriety  of  extending  some  aid  to  deserving young  men  of  moderate  means,  to  the  end  that  the  opportunities  here  afforded  for  a  higher  education  may  be improved  to  a  greater  extent  than  is  now  the  case.   As  the  Senate  is  based  on  population,  I would mention,  as one  plan,  that  each  Senator  be  allowed  to  name  one  person  residing  in  his  county  who  should  be  entitled  to tuition in the agricultural college. OTHER COLLEGES IN THE STATE. Middlebury  College  has  long  ranked  high  as  an  institution  of  learning.    It  has  sent  out many  distinguished graduates, not a  few of whom have  served  this Commonwealth  in positions of  responsibility, and  it deserves  to receive the confidence and fostering care of the people of the State. The  college  at Northfield  is  also doing good work  in  its  special  and  all other departments,  and  is worthy of every commendation. LIBRARY AND CABINET. Your  attention  will  doubtless  be  called  to  the  necessity  of  providing  additional  room  for  the  library  and cabinet.   I am  informed  that books are being stored  in  inaccessible places, and  that  the specimens  in the cabinet are being boxed and  laid away  for want of  room.   The matter  is one  for your examination and decision.   Of  the two  plans  submitted  by  the  commissioners  on  this  subject  I  much  prefer  the  one  which  contemplates  the erection of a separate library building, for the reason that I fear any extension of our State House would mar the symmetry  of  this  beautiful  structure.  It  would  certainly  seem  that  until  better  accommodation  is  provided,  the purchases for these objects should cease. In  making  any  arrangement  for  giving  more  room  to  the  library,  it  would  be  well  to  consider  carefully  its design and the nature and extent of its usefulness.  The last report of the trustees gives the number of volumes as 18,614,  but  does  not  classify  them  or  make  any  statement  as  to  their  use.    A  superficial  examination  of  the subject  leads me  to believe that  the State should purchase only such books as relate  to  law,  legislation, political economy and statistics.   If  the volumes of poetry,  fiction, biography, and other works of general  literature, now on  hand, were  presented  to  the  town  of Montpelier, with  suitable  restrictions,  and  no more  purchased,  it might relieve the immediate pressure for room to accommodate the books which are most useful to the Legislature and State  officers.   The  number  of  books  drawn  from  the  library  by members  and  officers  of  the Legislature  at  the last session was less than 600, and of this number over 200 were works of a miscellaneous character and fiction.  One hundred and forty members drew no books, but probably used the library for consultation and reference. NEW COMMITTEE. I  respectfully  suggest  the  propriety  and  benefit  of  forming  a  joint  standing  committee  on  phraseology,  by whom the language of all bills presented to the Legislature should be examined, and, if need be, corrected. The suggestion here made has been adopted by other States, and substantially in this State by the Legislature of 1880.  As a consequence of this action, one of the judges of the Supreme Court says:  “The public acts of the session  of  1880,  in  conciseness,  good  grammar,  and  perspicuity  surpass  the  laws  of  any  session  in  a  hundred years.   The  saving  in printing  alone more  than  twice paid  the  expense of  the  clerk who  revised  the  acts  as  they were introduced.  There is no measure of the expense incident to a badly-constructed law.” ATTORNEY-GENERAL Many  of  the  most  sagacious  and  careful  men  in  the  State  are,  and  have  long  been,  of  the  opinion  that  the office  of  Attorney-General  should  be  created,  in  order  to  secure  a  more  systematic,  uniform  and  universal execution of the criminal law, and also as a measure of real economy. It  has  been  found  necessary  to  establish  this  office  in  almost  every  State  in  the  Union.    In  our  own  State, each county and city, and nearly every incorporated village, has its law officer, but the State has none, and each year  it  pays  large  sums  to  special  counsel  employed  to  assist  the  State’s  Attorneys,  and  additional  sums  for other  legal services.   Some of  these expenses would be saved, and  in most cases  the services required would be better performed by a State officer. As one remedy for the expense caused by the frequent change of the State’s Attorneys, and the inexperience of  many  of  them,  Judge  Veazey,  in  his  report,  recommends  the  appointment  of  an  Attorney  General,  “who should have charge of and be responsible for the administration of the criminal law.”   On this subject I also ask your  attention  to  the  advice of Ex-Governor Horace Fairbanks,  found  in  this message  to  the General Assembly in1876. Questions of  law are constantly arising  in  the administration of State  affairs on which  the  advice of  an  able law  officer  is  required,  and  should  the  office  be  created,  I  am  confident  that  many  duties  of  importance  and value to the State would be imposed upon the incumbent. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. There  will  be  laid  before  you  the  proposals  of  amendment  to  the  Constitution,  six  in  number,  that  were adopted  by  the  last  General  Assembly.    These  proposals  were  examined  by  committees  in  each  house,  were published  at  the  time,  and  have  been  extensively  discussed  by  the  press.    They  should,  however,  receive  your close scrutiny; for the organic law of the State should not be lightly changed, and should be so clear as to admit of  no  doubt  as  to  construction.    Should  you  concur  in  any  or  all  of  them,  it  will  be  your  duty  to  provide  for  a submission of each one so concurred in to a direct vote of the people. One  of  these  proposals  greatly  restricts  the  power  of  the  Governor  to  pardon  or  commute  the  sentence  of persons  convicted  of  murder,  and,  if  adopted,  will  doubtless  lead  to  a  more  speedy  and  certain  punishment  of that crime, after conviction. Another  is  a  supplement  to  the  last  clause  of  section  26  of  the  Constitution,  which  reads  as  follows:  “Nor shall  any  person,  holding  any  office  of  profit  or  trust  under  the  authority  of  Congress,  be  eligible  to  any appointment in the Legislature, or of holding any executive or judiciary office under this State.” In  1880,  the  distinguished  member  from  Montpelier  resigned  a  lucrative  federal  office  to  serve  his townsmen in the Legislature, but this is a rare exception to the rule that the constitution is habitually violated in this respect. Persons  ineligible  under  the Constitution,  elected  to  the Legislature,  have  uniformly  been  good men,  and  it has not been  the duty of any particular person  to enforce  this provision.   But  its non-observance has not passed unnoticed,  for  the  press  has  always,  with  energy  and  perseverance,  called  attention  to  it,  so  that  the  whole people have  for years had  the spectacle persistently brought  to  their eyes, of  the  law-making power of  the State acting in open disregard of the Constitution.  The worst result wrought by this practice is the disrespect which it tends to create for law generally.  It teaches disregard for authority, and is a deplorable lesson to the people that constitutions  and  laws  are  only  to  be  obeyed  by  virtue  of  force.    The  proposed  amendment  is  designed  to remedy this state of affairs and make the existing clause of the Constitution self-operative. Another  proposal  relates  to  the  election  of  certain  State  officers.    It  is  now  the  duty  of  the  Legislature  to elect about twenty-five State officers at each session, and except in cases of re-election, they are usually chosen from  among  its  own  number  or  officers.    Hardly  any  other  State  adopts  this  practice  to  such  an  extent,  and  in many,  as  well  as  in  Congress,  it  is  unknown.    Every  Legislature  contains  men  who  are  fitted  by  experience, ability, and above all by their honest, independent character, to fill any office in the State, and many times these qualities are so conspicuously exhibited in the Legislature by such members, as to properly lead to their election to important offices.  The trouble rests in the fact that these men do not seek the offices, and they are left as the prey  of  another  sort  of  men  who  spend  their  time  in  forming  combinations  with  others  of  like  character  to advance  their  own  schemes,  and  these  combinations  frequently  extend  to  the  passage  or  defeat  of  pending measures.    At  the  same  time,  it  is  not  to  be  denied  that  some  of  our  best  and most  faithful  State  officers  have been  elected  by  Legislatures  of which  they were  not members,  and  that  offices  otherwise  elected  or  appointed have  not  always  proved  to  be  the  best.    The  practice,  at  its  best  distracts  attention  from  legislation,  prevents deliberation,  and,  by  lengthening  the  sessions,  is  very  expensive,  the  average  cost  per  day  of  actual  session being  estimated  at  one  thousand  dollars.    This  proposal  is  intended  to  bring  the  power  to  elect  two  important officials directly to the people. Another  proposal  is  one which  prohibits  the manufacture  and  sale  of  intoxicating  liquors,  and  is mainly  in accordance  with  the  long  existing  law  which  has  repeatedly  received  the  approval,  and  sanction  of  the  people through  their Legislatures.    It  is  to be observed, however,  that  the  law  allows  the  sale of  intoxicating  liquor  for medicinal, mechanical, and chemical purposes, while the proposed amendment restricts it to medicinal purposes only. In  this connection  I may allude  to  the  fact  that, owing  to disagreements between county commissioners and local  authorities,  many  towns  have  no  agency  for  the  sale  of  liquor,  thus  forcing  entire  communities  into  a violation of the law. In  considering  the  question  of  court,  jail,  pauper,  reform-school,  house  of  correction,  and  state  prison expenses, it is well always to bear in mind that a large share of them are directly traceable to the illegal traffic in intoxicating liquor, and that the enactment of laws or constitutional amendments tending to restrain and destroy this  evil,  is  in  the  direction  of moral  and  economical  legislation.   Men may  differ  as  to what  such  laws  should be, but those that are enacted should be uniformly enforced. OFFICIAL BONDS. I would suggest, as an  improvement  in  the form of official bonds now used  in  the State,  that  in all cases  the sureties  should  make  affidavit  on  such  bonds  as  to  their  qualification  in  property.    The  form  of  official  bond used by the United States Government required the sureties to make oath showing the amount of unencumbered property owned by them, over and above all debts and liabilities, to be double the penal sum named in the bond.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  adoption  of  this  feature  in  our  own  official  bonds  would  not  only  throw  about  the execution  of  these  important  instruments  an  increased  and  proper  solemnity,  resulting  in  better  security  to  the State, but would  also  relieve  in  some measure  those whose duty  it  is  to  approve  such bonds  from  the necessity of making inquiries as to the sufficiency of sureties. $382,821.00 30,849.00 4 per cent. 4½  “     “ . 5    “     “ . $439,624.00 710,514.00 SAVINGS BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES.

This  officer  bears  gratifying  testimony  to  the  skilful  and  honorable management  of  these  institutions  in  the main.    He  has  exercised  great  care  and  good  judgment  in  the  performance  of  his  duties,  and  I  trust  that  his recommendation  will  receive  your  serious  notice.    Coming  from  a  bank  officer,  they  are  likely  to  be  within, rather  than  in  excess  of  the  necessities  of  the  case.    His  cautious  but  decided  words  in  regard  to  certain  banks that  he  does  not  name,  if  not  heeded, may  lead  to  disaster  and distress.    I  especially  recommend  to your notice his remarks as to Trust Companies, and in regard to large loans to, and deposits from a single person. In  other  States  the  bank  officer  is  required  to  ascertain  and  report  the  number  and  amount  of  deposits remaining in each bank, undisturbed, for a certain number of years. The  increase  in  deposits  may  be  taken  as  an  indication  of  general  thrift  and  prosperity,  and,  though doubtless  some  portion  of  this  increase  is  due  to  the  fact  that  many  persons,  competent  to  manage  their  own property, are unable  to find a better place of  investment, yet, as a whole,  these deposits represent  the savings of years  of  toil  and  self-denial.    It  is  your  duty  to  see  that  all  the  safeguards  that  prudence  and  experience  can suggest  are  thrown  around  the  vital  interests  of  these  persons.    “Limited  deposits,  restricted  investments, economical management  and  conservative dividends, will  insure  security.”   But  laws will be of no  avail unless they  are  enforced.    The  Inspector  of  Finance  should  be  given  ample  power,  and  it  should  be made  his  duty,  to enforce  the  observance  of  the  law.   A mere  report  from  year  to  year  that  certain  banks  do  not  entirely  comply with the law will never remedy the evil. The suggestions of  this officer are not  to be  taken as  indicating distrust or criticism of  the way  in which  the banks are managed; on  the contrary,  they are mainly  intended  to point out  the steps already  taken by our oldest and soundest institutions, and which, in his opinion, should be followed by all. STATE BANKING LAW. Should  the National Government  continue  the  payment  of  its  bonds  at  the  represent  rate,  the  securities,  on which  rest  over  sixty  per  cent  of  the  national  banks  notes, will  be  extinguished  within  the  next  four  years.    In this event, it is not impossible that existing corporations may avail themselves of the provisions of the State law.  Hence, this law should be carefully examined, and be of such a nature as would afford absolute security to note-holders. INSANE ASYLUM. The management  of  this  private  charity  is  a  credit  and  an  honor  to  the  State.    Its  per-centage  of  deaths  and recoveries compares favorably with  that of similar  institutions elsewhere.    Its Trustees are scrupulously  faithful to  their  trust.    Dr.  Goldsmith  says:  “The  most  searching  inquiry  has  failed  to  find  that  a  single  dollar  of  the millions which have passed through their hands has ever been misapplied or unaccounted for.” The  Superintendent, Dr. Draper,  is  commended  in  the warmest  terms  by  those  able men who  in  past  years have  severely  criticized  the  construction  of  the Asylum  and  its  fitness  for  the  care  of  the  insane,  and  to whose efforts,  in  directing  attention  to  the  matter,  much  credit  is  doubtless  due  for  subsequent  improvement.    Dr. Fasset says: “Dr. Draper is an educated, intelligent man; has had many years’ experience in general practice and in the care of the insane; is a man of good judgment, kind and humane in disposition, devoted to his profession, zealous and earnest.”   He further says: “We are convinced  that the  food of  the  inmates  is abundant and of good quality.    The  entire  institution  is  kept  very  clean;  as  completely  so  as  any  Asylum  in  our  knowledge.    The inmates are decently clothes and their clothing, as well as their persons, is kept carefully clean. The most perfect good  order  prevails  throughout  the  entire  hospital.   Kindness  and  gentleness,  so  far  as  they  are  consistent with mechanical  restraint  and  seclusion,  are  everywhere  apparent.   We  believe  that  no  cruelty  or  harsh  treatment  on the  part  of  attendants  is  ever  permitted  if  known.”    The  present  Supervisors  say:  “We  believe  the Superintendent,  his  assistants,  and  employees  generally,  to  be  eminently  fit  for  the  business  in  which  they  are engaged,  and we  are quite  sure  that  there would be no distrust of  their kind  and  faithful  care of  all who  are put in their keeping.”  During  the past  few years,  the Trustees have  expended  large  sums  in  enlarging  and  improving  the Asylum.  They have added ventilation by means of a steam fan, new heating apparatus, a gymnasium, workshop, new and extensive park  and  summer  retreat, billiard, bowling,  and  reading  rooms, while  every ward now  opens  to  light, air and sunshine. It will  thus be seen  that nearly every cause  for  stricture has been  removed, and  that  the  institution deserves, and should receive the unreserved confidence of the people. One remaining source of complaint lies in the fact that the inmates are too numerous for the best good of all. INSANE POOR. This  unfortunate  class  deserve  our  deepest  commiseration  and  generous  care.    But  common  sense  and reason should not be left behind in our action for their relief.  The State should not be burdened with the support of transient poor from other States, or of those improperly committed by towns.  The Supervisors in their report say  that  some  town  authorities  “send  to  the  Asylum  all  their  paupers  who  are  in  the  least  demented,  idiotic  or vicious.”    It  has  also  been  clearly  charged  in  several  previous  reports  that  many  persons  are  confined  who should  be  taken  care  of  by  the  towns  from  which  they  came.    This  is  a  great  wrong  to  those  towns  that  deal justly with the State in this respect. Under  the  law  giving  the  Supervisors  the  right  to  discharge  all  persons  who  should  not  be  inmates,  they have  discharged  twenty-five,  and  say  they  would  have  sent  away  many  more  but  for  fear  they  would  become the  lawful prey of  the historic poor-house.    I believe  the  towns, as a  rule,  treat  their paupers with humanity and kindness,  and  that  the  “historic  poor-house”  is  a mere  tradition,  and  that  the  harmless,  incurable  insane  would receive  no  injury  from  being  returned  to  their  respective  towns.    The  State  should  support  none  but  those needing  restraint  and  medical  treatment.    The  supervisors  having  the  power,  it  should  be  made  their  duty,  to purge the Asylum of every such inmate.  If this were done, there would be abundant room for the best treatment of those who remain.  This distribution of the harmless insane poor among the alms-houses has been adopted in other States with favorable results, as regards both health and expense. With  the  greatest  respect  for  the  ability  and  high  character  of  the  Supervisors,  I  cannot  pass  without comment their views on THE LAW RELATIVE TO THE INSANE. After quoting from the report of the previous Board of Supervisors, that “the incarceration of the same in an insane asylum would be an impossibility in Vermont,” they say: “as the law now is, such a thing, in our opinion, would be by no means difficult.  .  .  . The law allows the careless opinion of two physicians to send any person to  an  asylum,  and  from  this  there  is  no  appeal.    Whose  dog  would  we  kill  without  more  sanctity  and  better evidence? And  yet  an  overworked,  nervous  and  sensitive woman,  if  she  becomes  disagreeable  to  an  unfaithful husband  or  other  interested  person, may  be  sent  to  an  asylum  by  any  two  inexperienced,  ignorant  or  designing physicians.” The law reads as follows: “Sec. 2906.    No  person,  except  as  hereinafter  provided,  shall  be  admitted  to,  or detained in an insane asylum, as a patient or inmate, except upon the certificate of such person’s insanity, made by two physicians of unquestioned integrity and skill.  .  .  .” “SEC. 2907. Such  certificates  shall  be  made  not  more  than  ten  days  previous  to  the  admission  of  such insane  person  to  the  Asylum,  and,  with  a  certificate  of  the  Judge  of  Probate  of  the  district  in  which  the physicians  reside,  that  such  physicians  are  of  unquestioned  integrity  and  skill  in  their  profession,  shall  be presented to the proper officer of the asylum at the time of such insane person is presented for admission.” “SEC. 2908. The  certificate  of  the  physicians  shall  be  given  only  after  a  careful  examination  of  the supposed  insane  person made  not more  than  five  days  previous  to making  the  certificate;  and  a  physician who signs  a  certificate  without  making  such  examination,  shall,  if  the  person  is  admitted  to  an  asylum  upon  the certificate, be fined not less than fifty dollars, nor more than one hundred dollars. It  will  be  observed  that  the  statement  is  made,  that  “there  is  no  appeal”  from  the  “careless  opinion  of  two physicians.”    While  this  may  be  technically  true,  it  is  one  of  the  main  duties  of  the  Supervisors  to  protect  all inmates  from  injustice.    The  law  directs  that  one  of  their  number  shall  visit  the  Asylum  as  often  as  once  a month,  and  that  they  shall  “hear  the  grievances  of  the  patients,  apart  from  their  officers  and  keepers,  and investigate  the  cases  that,  in  their  judgment,  require  special  investigation,  and  particularly  shall  ascertain whether persons are confined  in any asylum who ought  to be discharged, and shall make such orders  therein as each case requires.” This matter is presented at some length in the belief that it is a fair example of much of the adverse criticism to which the Asylum and our laws relative to the insane have been subjected for years, to the great detriment of the  institution  and  the  good  name  of  the  State.    But  if  the  Supervisors  have  found  that  in  its  practical working the law is defective, it should be amended. It has been strongly urged that such part of section 2893 as provides for the payment of one dollar a week by the State and for mileage, should be repealed. The good effect of State supervision is seriously interfered with by frequent changes of the officers.  Having a good board, we should  retain at  least one of  its members  in  the new board  to be elected.    It would be better  if the Supervisors were elected for two, four and six years respectively. In  regard  to  a  new  Asylum,  it may  be  stated  that  the  lowest  estimate  for  its  cost  is  $300,000,  and  as  to  its being in any measure self-sustaining, the Reform School may be mentioned as an illustration of the error of any such  expectation.    Its  projectors  claimed  that  plain,  substantial  buildings,  with  a  farm  in  connection,  were  all that  was  needed,  and  some  confidently  predicted  that  its  entire  cost  would  not  be  over  $20,000,  and  that  it would  hereafter  be  nearly  self-sustaining.    Instead  of  this,  we  have  an  expensive  structure,  and  the  school  has cost the State over $370,000, or over $20,000 per annum for 18 years.

The  most  noticeable  and  gratifying  feature  of  the  report  from  these  institutions  is  the  great  decrease  of inmates, as shown by the following table. Number of inmates in the respective institutions the first day of August: 1882 1880   1878  90 142 176 State Prison .................................................................................................... 86 122 Reform School ............................................................................................... 145 House of Correction ....................................................................................... 45 70  The main  cause  of  this  decrease  of  crime  is  doubtless  owing  to  the  great  demand  for  labor, which  removes the  temptations  that  are  always  occasioned  by  idleness.    There  has  been  drawn  from  the  treasury  for  new buildings, repairs and current expenses, during the two years ending July 1, 1882: For the State Prison ................................................................................................................      “      House of Correction ..................................................................................................      “      Reform School .......................................................................................................... and there has been returned from convict labor and other receipts: $25,354 From the State Prison ............................................................................................................. 14,363      “      House of Correction ..................................................................................................      “      Reform School .......................................................................................................... 1,071 It  is a matter of congratulation  that  the several superintendents are said  to be exceptionally able and faithful officials.    Good  discipline  is  maintained,  while  those  confined  are  treated  in  a  kind  and  humane  manner.    A small  appropriation  to  complete  out-buildings  is  asked  for  at  the  Prison  and  House  of  Correction.    None  is requested  for  special purposes at  the Reform School, but  its  equivalent  is  recommended  in  such  changes of  the law as will reduce its income. I  am  unable  to  agree  with  the  Trustees  of  the  Reform  School  in  their  recommendation  that  the  law  be repealed which requires towns to contribute to the support of the children they send to the School.  The greatest fault  found  with  the  working  of  the  Reform  School  has  been  that  children  were  improperly  sent  there  –  for trivial offenses, of tender age, and of weak minds – sent by towns merely to be rid of them, thus throwing upon the State  the  expense  that  should  be  borne  by  the  towns.   Ex-Governor Dillingham, while  trustee,  asserted  this in strong  terms, saying, also,  in one of his  reports,  that over  sixty  improper commitments had been made under the vagrant or  tramp  law alone.   The  law obliging  towns  to pay a portion of  the expense of  the School has been passed  entirely  with  a  view  to  preventing  improper  commitments.    To  repeal  it  would  be  another  mark  of changeable  legislation,  repealing  laws  before  they  have  been  fairly  tested.   The School might  again  be  flooded with  mere  vagrants  from  the  large  villages,  and  we  should  again  be  called  upon  to  enlarge  the  buildings.  Communities should not be relieved of all responsibility in regard to truant boys. MILITIA. A  force  of  disciplined militia  is  a  vital  necessity  in  any  State,  as  it  is  the  last  resort  for  the  enforcement  of the  law.    It  is  the  only  power  that  can  vindicate  the  rights  and  preserve  the  liberties  of  the  State  in  certain emergencies,  without  calling  upon  the  general  government,  and  its  existence  may  prevent  the  necessity  for  its $75,126 27,141 37,174 use.    Our  military  force  is  small,  consisting  of  one  regiment  and  battery,  but  its  efficiency  is  asserted  by  the Adjutant-General,  and  I  am  informed  that  constant  efforts  are  being  made  by  the  field  and  line  officers  to improve its condition.  The State is under obligations to all its members for their sacrifice of time and labor and for  their  efforts  to  preserve  the  martial  spirit  of  the  people.    Certain  business  men  of  wealth  have  for  years greatly aided the regiment and battery, and to them also our acknowledgments are due. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. The  board  serves  a  useful  purpose  in  arousing  the  attention  of  farmers  to  a  proper  sense  of  the  importance and  dignity  of  their  calling,  and  in  disseminating  valuable  knowledge  in  regard  to  improved  agricultural methods.  So many of your number are familiar with the importance and necessity of the board, that I doubt not every measure calculated to enhance its value will receive your cordial support. FISHERIES. I  am  informed  that your  attention will  be  called  to  the necessity  of  some  change  in  the  present  law  relating to the protection of fish. The subject is one of no little importance to many persons, particularly to those living on the shores of Lake Champlain, and to the thousands who there make their summer homes. The Fish Commissioners have practical and scientific knowledge, and I trust that ample power will be given them, or other proper persons, to enforce such laws as are enacted. METHOD OF TAXATION. Many writers on  this subject hold  that only real estate should be  taxed, while  the other extreme view would tax all property, visible and invisible, the amount of invisible property to be ascertained by placing every person under  oath  as  to  the  list  returned  by  him.      The  latter  is  substantially  our  present  plan,  though  we  make  many exemptions  in both  classes,  and  allow offsets  for debts, against personal property.   You will probably be asked to  enact  a  law  by  which  offsets  can  be  made  against  real  estate,  to  the  amount  of  the  mortgages  thereon,  but such  relief would  not  be  uniform  unless  extended  to  debts  not  secured  by mortgage.   Such  laws would  be  just, but would  tend  to  increase  the number of mortgages, and  to perpetuate  those already existing.   Exemptions and offsets  should  be  abolished,  or made  uniform  upon  every  species  of  property.    Perhaps  equal  justice would  be done by abolishing offsets, which in our last list amounted to over $32,000,000.  This sum, added to the present valuation,  would  greatly  decrease  the  rate  per  cent  of  taxation,  and  be  more  uniform  and  just  than  the  present system.    In any event,  justice demands  that  the owners of  real and personal property  should be put on  the  same basis of equality. The present law was the result of an earnest, honest effort to equalize the burdens of taxation, and to remedy the  evils  notoriously  existing  under  the  old  law.    The  step  having  been  taken,  and  apparently  approved  by  the people,  no  pains  should  be  spared  to  make  the  law  as  perfect  as  possible.    By  its  operation,  the  amount  of personal  property  subject  to  taxation  has  been  more  increased  than  that  of  real  estate,  relieving  to  this  extent, only,  the owners of  real property.   Those who pay only a poll  tax have  received  the greatest benefit, and  this  is the class that most deserves relief. The appraisal of 1881, without equalizing boards, created perhaps the most unequal real estate grand list we have  ever  had.    That  of  1882,  after  equalization,  is  much  more  uniform,  but  is  far  from  perfect.    When  the county  boards  meet,  the  fact  that  one  of  their  number  is  to  be  chosen  a member  of  the  State  board,  has  a  bad effect.    I  would  suggest  that,  in  future,  State  boards  be  appointed  by  the  Governor  from  the  members  of  the county  boards,  or  that  it  be  made  the  duty  of  county  boards  to  elect  their  members  of  the  State  board  before doing any other business. It  is  claimed  that  the  present  appraisal  of  railroad  property,  not  having  been  submitted  to  the  equalizing board, is much lower than it should be, and this deserves your attention. No law will prevent the “race of fraud” to escape taxation.  It will never cease until State taxes are raised in some other manner.  Several States pay their entire ordinary expenses by a tax on corporations.  A bill adopting this  system  was  presented  to  the  last  Legislature  by  Ex-Governor  Page,  of  Rutland.    Another  plan  is  that embraced  in  a  bill  introduced  by Senator Dwinell  at  the  same  session, by which State  taxes  are  to be  levied on towns according  to population.   While  this would not be entirely uniform, as no  tax  levy can be,  it would  seem to be more so than our present system.  To both these plans I respectfully ask your attention.  You will doubtless endeavor  to  regulate  our  method  of  taxation  so  that  it  shall  conform  to  the  principle  of  the  Constitution,  that every member of society is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expenses of the State. The following table shows the changes in the State grand list for the last five years: 1878  Real Estate .........................................................................................  $92,568,432 Personal Property ............................................................................... 16,845,123  ------------------    $109,413,555  1880  1881 $102,437,102 Real Estate .............................................................  $71,114,747 46,896,967 Personal Property ................................................... 15,037,262 ------------------  ------------------  $86,152,009 $149,334,069 The direct taxes levied and collected for the last two years were $497,097. SUPREME COURT. It  is  generally  believed  that  the  last  increase  of  the  number  of  Judges was  unnecessary,  but  since  that  time the  cases  involving  large  amounts  have  increased,  and  it  is  claimed  that  the  time  of  the  Bench  is  now  fully occupied  in  official  duties.    Two  years  since,  the  illness  of  Judge  Pierpoint  was  urged  as  a  reason  for  not reducing  the  number  of  Judges,  and  now,  the  somewhat  impaired  health  of  Judge  Redfield,  causing  a  general regret,  affords  a  similar  reason.    The  reputation  of  the  Court  for  impartial  independence,  and  for  learning  and ability, is such as to be a just cause of satisfaction, and it would not be good policy to impose such an additional amount of labor upon them as would cause the resignation of any, particularly the elder members. RAILROAD COMMISSIONER. This  officer  makes  a  sensible,  business-like  report,  and  very  properly  asks  that  a  law  be  enacted  insuring greater  safety  of  passengers  by  requiring  each  car  to  be  provided  with  axes  and  bars  and  with  more  secure heating apparatus. 1879 $71,017,981 15,375,533 ----------------- $86,393,514 1882 $106,577,599 46,996,025 ------------------ $153,573,584 RAILROAD LEGISLATION. Few  subjects  attract  so  much  attention  and  occupy  so  much  time  in  State  Legislatures  and  Congress.    It presents many new problems, and we cannot look to the past for a guide to their solution.   It should not be kept out  of  sight  and  discussion,  nor  raised  to  undue  prominence.    In  its  consideration  we  should  be  free  from  the influence of railroad corporations, and from that of demagogues who seek to create hostility to railroad interests in order to obtain some personal advantage.  We should never forget the vast benefits Vermont has derived from her  railroads.    It  has  been  well  said  that  “We  have  no  means  of  forming  a  correct  estimate  of  how  much  has been  added  to  the wealth,  comfort,  prosperity,  and power of our State by  the  construction  and operation of our great  railroad  system,  by  the  facilities  they  have  furnished  for  travel  and  transportation,  by  the  markets  they have  opened,  and  by  the  value  they  have  given  to  other  property.”    But when  complaints  arise  that  the  people are  not  afforded  the  same  facilities  in  freight  and  passage  that  are  extended  to  other  communities  by  the  same lines:    that  discriminations  in  freight  rates  are  made  between  persons  and  places:  that  rebates  and  special contracts  are  allowed  to  some  and  denied  to  others:  that  unjust  combinations  exist  whereby  consumers  are obliged to pay more than a fair price for articles in common use:  that large numbers travel without pay, thereby increasing the price paid by others: that the farmers of the West can place their products in the Boston market as cheaply  as  can  the  farmers  of  Vermont:    that  our  small  villages  are  becoming  undesirable  places  of  residence and  business,  for  the  reason  that  they  cannot  be  reached  or  left  by  through  trains:    that  manufacturers  are deterred  from  locating  in  the  State,  by  reason  of  uncertain  and  high  rates  of  freight:    it  manifestly  becomes  a proper topic for legislative consideration. The  power  of  the  state  to  regulate  and  control  railroad  corporations  and  protect  the  interest  of  the  people  will not be denied.   The  late Hon. George P. Marsh, who was our second railroad commissioner, says  in one of his  reports:  “The  undersigned  entertains  no  doubt  of  the  legal  power  of  the  Legislature  to  subject  railroad corporations  in all respects  to such general regulations as  the public moral and material  interests may demand.”  But  this power should be used with caution.   Customs  in force and  long-established  in  this and adjoining States cannot  be  suddenly  changed  here while  still  in  force  elsewhere without  great  detriment  to  our  railroads.   Some of the evils complained of can and should be remedied by State legislation, but we should stop short of enacting laws hampering our railroads, so as unnecessarily to impair their prosperity or their power to compete with lines in other States. Vermont  is  fortunate  in  having  her  railroads  operated  by  her  own  citizens,  men  of  liberality  and  public spirit, deeply  interested  in whatever  relates  to  the prosperity and welfare of  the State.    It  is a general belief  that they are conducted with a spirit of courtesy and accommodation,  that every exertion  is made by  their managers to please and satisfy the people in all their gatherings at fairs and public meetings.  It is highly desirable that this state  of  things  should  continue.    No  class  controversy  should  arise  between  those  who  are  mutually  interested and dependent upon each other. Realizing  that  it was  impossible  to  frame  a  law  to meet  all  requirements, Mr. Marsh,  in  the  same  report  to which  I  have  referred,  says:    “.    .    .    .the  proper  remedy  is  the  creation  of  a  board  to  which,  under  proper restrictions,  the  general  controlling  power  of  the  State  over  the  management  of  railroad  companies  shall  be delegated.”    Should  the  power  of  the  State  be  so  vested,  I  have  no  doubt  that  every  cause  of misunderstanding within  the  State  would  be  adjusted  in  an  honorable  and  amicable  manner.    But  no  Board  or  Legislature  can reach outside the State, and much that is wrong in these matters is the result of the great national and continental system,  controlled  by  immense  and  consolidated  wealth,  a  system  in  which  Vermont  roads  are  as  a  drop  in  a bucket, a  link  in a chain.    It  is a power  so great  that  small corporations  like  those  in Vermont are  forced  to  join and  strengthen  it,  or  perish.    We  can,  however,  imitating  the  example  of  many  other  State  Legislatures,  give such  expression  to  our  views  as  shall  arouse  our  State  delegation  in  Congress  to  assist  the  national movement for  the  regulation  of  inter-State  commerce,  the  power  to  do  which  was  vested  in  Congress  by  the  founders  of our  national  constitution.    The  propriety  of  expressing  to  the  State  delegation  in  Congress  your wishes  on  any subject has often been  recognized by  the action of Legislatures, notably  in  two  instances, when  the welfare and material  interests  of  the  State  were  threatened  by  efforts  to  secure  the  renewal  of  the  reciprocity  treaty  with Canada. GENERAL CONDITION OF THE STATE. The census of 1880 again shows  that our  rural population and wealth are decreasing, while our villages and cities gain only a little more than enough to compensate for the loss in the country towns.  The reduction of our representation  in  Congress  also  forcibly  reminds  us  that  our  beloved  State  is  not  keeping  pace  with  others  in material prosperity and development.   This  fact  should cause every  thoughtful  and patriotic  citizen  earnestly  to consider and study its causes and to strive to remove them if possible.  Have complaints as  to railroad management, elsewhere mentioned, deterred capital from entering  the State?  Are  our  laws  in  regard  to manufactures,  quarries  and mines  such  as  to  induce  investments  therein?    Is  it worth while  to  try  to  attract  within  our  limits  a  portion  of  that  vast  stream  of  population  which  is  pouring  into  this country?  These are most pertinent inquiries at this time. The scarcity of  labor  through  the State  is well known.   Many, who a  few years since were day-laborers, are now  land-owners  and  employers,  respectable,  honest,  law-abiding  citizens.    I  suggest  that  you  consider  the propriety  of making  the Quartermaster General,  or  other  State  officer,  the medium  of  communication  between the  commissioners  of  immigration  at  New  York  and  Boston,  and  such  of  our  citizens  as  desire  to  provide suitable homes and occupation for deserving and industrious persons arriving at those ports seeking for work. Gentlemen:    You  are  here  by  the  recent  voice  of  the  people  to  deal  with  many  important  legislative  and constitutional  questions,  and  although  most  of  you  are  new  to  the  duties  of  your  respective  positions,  I  am confident  that  your  acts  will  be  consistent  with  the  simplicity  of  our  form  of  government,  and  that  they  will evince the highest regard for the welfare of the State. I am deeply  sensible of my own  inexperience  and deficiencies,  and  shall need your kind  forbearance  in our mutual efforts to benefit the State.  }  EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,      Montpelier, Vt. Oct. 5, 1882   JOHN L. BARSTOW.
