Executive  Speech of  Jonas Galusha  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume VI.  1817      October, 10, 1817. SPEECH OF GOV. GALUSHA– 18171.  Gentlemen  of  the  Council,  and  Gentlemen  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  –  Permit me,  on  this  occasion, with  gratitude,  to  express  the  satisfaction  I  feel  that  the  freemen  of  this  State  have  so  far  approved  my  past conduct, as again to honor me with  their confidence. It  is  a  source  of  peculiar  gratification  that we  are  convened  under  circumstances  the most  propitious.   That universal gloom with fearful apprehensions of extreme want spread over the mind at the close of the last season, and  the  commencement  of  the  present,  has  by  the  extraordinary  frugality  of  the  people,  succeeded  by  the blessing of heaven, been happily dispelled, and the dreadful distress but lightly felt.  We have abundant cause of gratitude  to  the  Author  of  all  our  benefits  for  the  luxuriant  harvest  of  the  present  year,  the  unusual  degree  of health which has prevailed  throughout this State,  the general harmony existing among us, and above all, for  the right and recent spiritual harvest which, in many places, has been truly great.2The  deficiency  of  a  circulating  medium,  owing  to  an  increased  emigration  of  our  inhabitants  to  the  west, who  have  converted  their  property  into  cash  for  transportation,  and  the  unfruitfulness  of  past  seasons,  in addition  to  the  common  causes which  uniformly  produce  a  scarcity  of money  at  the  close  of  a war,  has  caused some serious embarrassments; but  the  industry and economy  it has excited has nearly counterbalanced  the evils experienced.    By  the  pursuance  of  this  prudent  course,  if  attended  with  the  ordinary  smiles  of  Providence,  we shall  soon  possess  a  suitable  portion  of  circulating  medium,  without  resorting  to  the  ruinous  system  of  paper credit.   The  act  of  last  session making  it  penal  to  pass  any  bill  or  note  of  a  less  sum  than  one  dollar,  in  lieu  of money, has had its desired effect in preventing further impositions, without introducing any material evil. No  important  political  changes  among  foreign  powers,  affecting  the  interest  of  this,  or  the  United  States, have  come  to my  knowledge  since  our  last  session.   The nations of Europe  remain  settled on  their  lees. Happy would  it  have  been  had  their  contests  terminated  for  favorably  to  the  rights  and  liberties  of  the  people.    But notwithstanding  some  symptoms which  excite  fond,  yet  feeble  expectations  of  amelioration of  the  condition of that  long  devoted  country,  multitudes  of  her  inhabitants,  awakened  to  a  sense  of  their  sufferings,  and  aspiring for  liberty,  are  resorting  to  the  United  States,  the  only  present  asylum  for  oppressed  and  afflicted  humanity.  These  emigrants,  with  many  of  our  own  citizens,  are  rapidly  settling  and  cultivating  the  western  wilds,  where they will soon form a strong barrier against savage barbarities, and foreign encroachments. The  inhabitants of  the  southern part of  this  continent  are  still  struggling  for  freedom  and  independence,  the issue  of  which  must  decide  the  happiness  or  misery  of  millions  of  the  present  and  succeeding  generations.    It will essentially affect not only our commercial states, but the world at large.  Should emancipation be the event, we may  rationally  hope,  ere  long,  to  see  arts  and  science,  agriculture,  commerce  and manufactures  flourishing throughout  that  vast,  populous  and  fertile  region,  and  every  rank  of  its  habitants  in  the  full  fruition  of  all  the blessings  of  civil  and  religious  liberty,  unshackled  by  superstition,  uncircumscribed  by  the  edicts  of  kings.  While we anticipate the prosperity of others, let us critically attend to all the probably means of heightening our own.3Improvement in manufacturing is a subject so closely connected with the interest of this State, that it cannot fail  of  engaging  your  attention.    It  should  be  the  policy  of  a State  so  remote  from  the  great marts  of  the world, and not adjacent to the sea-board, to adopt every prudent measure to supply her wants by her own manufacture; by  which  means  she  prevents  the  emigration  of  many  of  her  valuable  citizens  to  other  parts  of  the  country  to find employment, makes a neat saving of the expense of transporting that portion of provision consumed by the manufacturers, and turns the balance of exports and imports in her own favor.  Little need be said to recommend an object of such apparent importance.                                                  1 From printed Assembly Journal of 1817, p. 14.  2 This is the first, and probably the only instance in which a governor of Vermont has alluded to revivals of religion in the annual message. 3 This refers to the revolution in a part of the South American provinces under Simon Bolivar y Ponte, who in 1821 became President of the Republic of Columbia, and later of Bolivia and Peru. I would  suggest  for your consideration,  the propriety of an early and  thorough examination of  the affairs of the  State  prison,  to  ascertain  whether  any  improvement  can  be  made  in  the  employment  of  the  convicts,  or better economy introduced relative to the expense of their subsistence. If  the state of our finances will admit, I am of  the opinion,  that  to purchase a stock of materials, prepare  the proper  machinery,  and  employ  a  part  of  the  prisoners  in  manufacturing  woolen  cloth,  would  be  a  more profitable  than  to  employ  so  large  a  portion  of  the  laborers  in  weaving  cotton,  especially  while  the  depressed state  of  factories  renders  that  business  so  disadvantageous.   From  the  present  value  of woolen  cloth,  compared with  the  price  of  the  raw  materials,  it  is  evident  that  a  handsome  saving  might  be  made  to  the  State  by  the manufacture  of  that  article.    I  would  also  recommend  the  purchasing  of  a  small  tract  of  pasture  land  in  the vicinity of the prison, for the purpose of keeping cows, which would be a means of furnishing the prisoners with a cheap and wholesome diet during the warm seasons of the year. It will  be  found  necessary,  even  if  the  present  system  of  labor  be  continued,  to  erect  additional workshops, unless  some  other  mode  of  punishment,  for  crimes  of  small  magnitude,  should  be  deemed  preferable  to confinement in the state prison. An  elegant  map  of  the  state  of  New  Hampshire  has  been,  by  that  government,  presented  to  the  state  of Vermont, which, with  the  laws of  several of  the  sister  states,  I have caused  to be  transported  to  this place  to be deposited as the general assembly shall direct. Sundry  communications,  from different departments of  the general government,  and  from  individual  states, have  been  made  to  me  during  the  last  year.    All  those  designed  for  your  consideration  will  be  seasonably submitted. Permit  me,  gentlemen,  before  I  close,  to  express  the  entire  confidence  I  feel,  not  only  in  your  intelligence and ability, but also  in  the purity of your  intentions,    to manage concerns of your constituents  in such a manner as  shall  tend  to  ensure  their  equal  rights  and promote  their highest happiness.   The  importance of our  trust will be realized when we compare our distinguished privileges with those of the people of any other country. We find ourselves, after the most arduous and threatening conflicts, by the interposition of divine goodness, at  peace  with  all  nations,  tranquil  and  happy  among  ourselves,  and  in  the  full  participation  of  every  right, whether moral, civil or religious.  It  is  the  imperious  duty  of  the  legislature,  as  the  faithful  guardians  of  those  sacred  rights,  under  every circumstance,  to  watch  over  them  with  peculiar  care,  cherish  every  principle,  and  employ  every  means  that tends  to  support  and  perpetuate  them;  among  which  may  be  ranked  general  information,  industry,  frugality, science,  morality  and  pure  religion.    While  these  prevail,  we  may  safely  rely  on  the  continuance  of  all  the blessings of our free and equitable government. Under  these  considerations,  our  attention  will  naturally  be  drawn  to  the  promotion  of  education,  in  all  its various  branches,  as  the  most  powerful  barrier  against  those  errors  of  sentiment  and  practice,  which  corrupt, misguide, and enslave a people. My best endeavors will be used  to carry  into effect such measures as you  in your wisdom shall adopt.   And may sagacity, prudence, unanimity and firmness characterize the proceedings of our present session. JONAS GALUSHA
