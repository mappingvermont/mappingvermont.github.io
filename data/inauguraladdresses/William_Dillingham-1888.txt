Inaugural address of  William P. Dillingham  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1888  Thursday, October 4, 1888 Inaugural Address  TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF VERMONT: In  the  preparation  of  such  business  as  appears  to  me  necessary,  in  conformity  with  the  constitutional provisions  in  that  regard,  to  lay before  the general assembly,  I have been profoundly  impressed with a  sense of the great wisdom exercised by the founders of our state, and of the patriotism, purity of purpose and intelligence of those who, since the adoption of the constitution, have enacted, interpreted and administered the laws. There  appears  to have been,  at  all  times,  a  firm purpose  to  adhere  strictly  to  the principles  embodied  in  the declaration  of  rights  and  to  such  a  degree  have  the  privileges  and  immunities  of  the  individual  been  protected that present  legislation  is necessarily  limited,  for  the most part,  to  those matters  that  relate more  particularly  to the  welfare  of  the  people  as  a  body.  And  in  this  direction  such  progress  has  been  made  that  the  law-maker  is more  concerned  in  perfecting  what  has  already  been  established  than  in  the  inauguration  of  new  lines  of legislation. REPORTS OF STATE OFFICERS. Before  alluding  to  a  few  of  the  many  matters  that  may  occupy  your  attention  during  the  present  session,  I wish  to  refer  to  the  very  serious  embarrassment  suffered  by  the  incoming  Governor  in  his  inability  to  find access  to  the  biennial  reports  of  the  several  state  officers  in  season  to  become  familiar  with  the  condition  of public  business  and  the  requirements  of  the  different  departments  prior  to  the  time  when  he  must  prepare  his inaugural  address.  Some  of  the  most  important  of  these  reports  have  not  yet  come  under  my  eye;  others  were received  too  late  to  be  of  any  substantial  service;  while  only  a  few  were  obtained  in  season  to  be  properly considered. The  fault does not  rest on  the  state officers,  but  lies  in  the  provisions  of  the  law,  and  I  recommend such  amendments  thereto  as  will  make  the  fiscal  year  in  this  state  correspond  with  that  of  the  general Government  and  end  with  the  last  day  of  June,  and  that  all  laws  relating  to  the  preparation  and  printing  of reports of state officers be so amended as to make such reports forthcoming one month earlier than at present. FINANCES. The following statement prepared by the state treasurer shows the liabilities and resources of the state at the close of the last fiscal year. LIABILITIES. Due towns, U.S. surplus fund ................................................................................................ Due soldiers, unpaid balances  ............................................................................................... Due  Agricultural  college  fund  (represented  by  state  bonds, falling  due  June  1,  1890,  interest  payable  to  the  college 135,500  00 semi-annually) .......................................................................................................................  Due on appropriation for Gettysburg monument and grounds  6,880  00   -----------------    $l63,656 34  $12,916  37 8,359  97 RESOURCES. Cash on hand and in banks..................................................................................................... $88,062  30 Estimated amount of tax from corporations for 1888 ............................................................   230,000  00 Estimated proceeds from balance of Huntington fund securities .......................................... 13,000  00  ------------------   $331,062  30  It will  be  noticed  that  the  resources  now  provided  for  exceed  present  liabilities  in  the  sum  of  $167,405.96.  This  result  is more  satisfactory when  considered  in  connection with  the  other  fact,  that  during  the  last  biennial term the amount of state expenses has been greater by $166,350.70 than that of the last preceding term. As  to  the  causes  contributing  to  this  increase  of  expense  you  are  referred  to  the  report  of  the  auditor  of accounts, in which you will find a full statement of the same. In  this  connection  I desire  to  call your  attention  specially  to  that portion of  the  auditor’s  report  in which he discusses  court  expenses  and  the  great  saving  to  the  state  since  1880  in  the  enforcement  of  a  rule  requiring justices  of  the  peace  and  other  persons  holding,  or  responsible  for,  fines  and  costs,  or  other  funds  belonging  to the  state,  to  account  for  the  same  before  having  their  bills  of  costs  or  counter  claims  allowed. He  informs  you that  his  right  to  enforce  such  rule  has  been  stoutly  denied,  and  asks  for  legislative  provision  in  that  behalf. Inasmuch  as  the  amount  of  fines  and  costs  paid  in  to  the  treasury  under  the  operation  of  this  rule  is  nearly double  that  paid  in  during  a  corresponding  term  previous  to  its  adoption,  his  recommendations  deserve  careful consideration  and  such  legislation  as will  result  in  the  collection of  every dollar due  the  state,  and  the payment of the same into the treasury. PENAL AND REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS. I  am  not  aware  that  the  state  prison,  house  of  correction  or Vermont  reform  school  has  any  special  need  to be provided for. The reports of the directors and trustees indicate a commendable state of affairs at each of these institutions. It  appears,  however,  that  the  house  of  correction  has  at  times  been  overcrowded  with  inmates,  while  the state prison has not been full. This has been caused by sending those convicted of high crimes and sentenced to long  terms  of  imprisonment  to  the  house  of  correction  rather  than  to  the  prison,  where  they  more  properly belong. Two years ago  the directors called attention  to  the matter and urged  legislation  that would prevent such commitments;  this  year  they  again  speak  of  it,  and  urge  that  provision  be  made  that  will  send  this  class  of prisoners to the state prison, where they can be more safely guarded, more profitably employed, and where they will be in all respects as well treated. INSANE ASYLUM. An  examination  of  the  report  of  the  trustees  of  the  Vermont  asylum  discloses  the  fact  that  for  many  years past it has been filled to its greatest capacity and has in fact, been overcrowded. The institution is not capable of properly  accommodating  more  than  four  hundred  patients,  and  yet  the  average  number  of  inmates  during  the last  ten  years  has  been  four  hundred  and  forty-five.  To  add  to  the  embarrassment  caused  by  this  excess  in numbers, the discharges since 1878, under the direction of the state board of supervisors, have been from among that class of patients whose  insanity had become chronic and were considered harmless, and  the places vacated by  these  quiet  and  easily managed  persons  have  been  taken  by  a  like  number  of  noisy,  destructive  and  violent patients. ‘‘Where  the former class could be safely associated and provided for  in dormitories,  the  latter requires for the most part single apartments,” so that in the shifting of patients from one location to another it frequently happens that inmates are brought in contact with each other who would not be for any other reason; hence as the trustees  state,  “the  overcrowding  subverts  a  proper  classification,  as  well  as  interferes  with  the  feeling  of contentment  which  depends  so  largely  upon  the  surroundings  of  the  patient.”  Added  to  the  troubles  already enumerated  is  the  further  fact  that  during  the  two  past  years  the  average  number  of  inmates  has  been  four hundred  and  sixty-one,  or  sixty-one  more  than  the  asylum  can  properly  accommodate.  This  increase  has,  to  a large  extent,  been  caused  by  the  operation  of  the  so  called  Poland  pauper  law,  under  which,  as  the superintendent states, about twenty have been committed to the asylum, chiefly to relieve the towns from which they came of the burden of supporting them. It  is claimed by  the  trustees, considering  the relation of  the  institution  to  the state,  that  they ‘‘are not  legally holden  to care for  the  transient, nor under obligation  to receive  the convict and criminal  insane,” and  that at  the rate  of  increase  of  admissions  which  has  been  going  on,  some  process  of  exclusion  may  be  forced  upon  them before  another  biennial  period  has  elapsed.  The  trustees make  no  suggestions  as  to  the  course  the  state  should adopt, nor as to what they, as trustees, desire in the matter. It appears that of the class known as the convict insane there are less then twenty in this institution, so that if other provision  should be made  for  them  the  asylum would not be  sensibly  relieved.  It  also  appears  from other sources  that  there are over nine hundred cases of  insanity  in  the state, and  that  they are constantly  increasing  in number, which,  taken  in  connection with  the present over  crowded  condition of  the asylum,  and  the  increasing demand for admission to it, leads irresistibly to the conclusion that immediate steps must be taken by the state to further provide for this unfortunate class. Whether it shall be by the erection of a state asylum at some convenient point, capable of accommodating a part or all of the insane poor and such private patients as may be desired, and upon a plan which will permit, of additions or extensions as the needs of the state may require, or whether the state will contract with the Vermont asylum for the erection of other buildings in connection with that institution and make provisions for the care of all its insane poor at that place, or whether some other or different plan shall be adopted, is a question for you to determine.  I  lean  to  the  opinion  that  the  first  named  plan  is  the  best,  but, without  urging my  own  views  in  that regard,  I  do  most  earnestly  recommend  to  your  attention  the  absolute  necessity  of  immediate  action  of  some kind for the relief of this class of unfortunates whose capacity to suffer seems all that is left them. UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT AND STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. The university of Vermont comes to you this year with an earnest appeal for that substantial aid and support which, it is claimed, the founders of the state contemplated when the institution was founded. The  trustees  in  their exhaustive and comprehensive report call attention  to  the advantages  that have resulted from the gifts of Mr. Howard and Mr. Billings, ‘‘the increase in the members of the faculty, the doubling of the attendance  of  students  within  a  few  years,  the  gradual  advancement  of  the  standard  of  scholarship,  the enrichment  of  the  curriculum  by  the  introduction  of  scientific  and  elective  courses,  the  manifestations  of confidence  and  interest  through  gifts  and  legacies,  the  flourishing  condition  and  high  character  of  the  medical department,  and  the  universal  impression  throughout  the  state  and  abroad  that  the  university  is  in  a  prosperous and progressive condition,” and urge these circumstances as an indication that the present is a favorable time for a strenuous effort on the part of all interested to secure for the university increased power and a broader field of usefulness in the future. They  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  a  grant  of  state  aid  was  ‘‘contemplated  in  the  original  plan  of  the university as conceived by  the founders of  the state, and was carried forward  in  the best way which  the poverty of those early times admitted, by the reservation of town lots for the benefit of the university;” also that the state has recognized its interest in and relation to the institution in making its state officers ex-officio members of the corporation,  in  the reservation of the ‘‘right to appoint one half of  its board of control, and  to exercise visitorial power  over  all  its  affairs  and  proceedings.” They  also  claim  that  by  the  charter  of  1865  the  state  assumed  new relations  to  the  university  and  imposed  upon  it  obligations  far  in  excess  of  the  benefit  derived  from  the  fund donated  by  the  general  government,  and  that  in  entering  into  the  great  and  difficult  work  of  adding  to  the ancient  curriculum  ‘‘the  large  array  of  new  sciences, with  their  applications, with which modern  invention  has enhanced  human  knowledge,”  the  university  did  it  with  the  certainly  reasonably  presumption  that  the  state would,  in  addition  to  the  wholly  inadequate  congressional  aid,  make  liberal  grants  from  time  to  time  in furtherance  of  the  objects  contemplated  in  the  charter.”   And  the  trustees  referring  to  the  relation  borne  by  the state to the university, make use of the following language:  “She has not only a duty to perform, such a duty as rests  on  all  enlightened  states  toward  the  institution  with  which  she  entered  into  partnership  by  the  charter  of 1865.” I have thus called special attention to the report of the trustees because of the great importance of its subject matter,  and  because  of  the  intelligence,  learning  and  character  of  its  authors.    I  bespeak  for  this  report  the examination  and  consideration  it deserves,  and  if  its arguments  commend  themselves  to your  judgment  as well founded,  and  its  demands  seem  to  you  just  and  reasonable,  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  such  action  may  be  taken  as will place the university upon a plane of usefulness befitting an institution of its character. Your attention is called to an act of congress entitled “An act to establish agricultural experiment stations in connection with  the  colleges  established  in  the  several  states, under provisions of  an  act  approved  July  second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the acts supplementary thereto,” under which an appropriation of fifteen thousand  dollars  annually  is  made  to  each  state  for  the  purpose  of  paying  the  expenses  of  conducting  such stations. Section nine of  this  act provides  “that  the grants of moneys  authorized by  this  act  are made  subject  to the  legislative  assent  of  the  several  states  and  territories  to  the  purposes  of  said  grant.” This  calls  for  action  on your part. It will also be incumbent upon you to elect three members of the board of trustees on the part of the state, to serve six years, beginning November, 1889. SAVINGS BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES. The  report  of  the  inspector  of  finance  is  a  document  so  full  of  valuable  information  in  regard  to  the management and present condition of the savings banks and trust companies of the state that I cannot consent to mar its completeness, either in making extracts or in attempting to state its substance. It should be carefully read by every legislator and the recommendations therein contained considered in connections with the reasons upon which  they are  founded. Most of  these  institutions are,  in most  respects, models of  financial management but  if disaster  should  befall  any  of  them  by  reason  of  too  extensive  investments  in western mortgages,  or  because  of dividends  to  depositors  larger  than  prudent management would  dictate,  the  inspector would  not  be  in  fault. He has  repeatedly  called  attention  to  what  he  conceives  to  be  a  danger  and  has  laid  the  responsibility  for  action upon  the  general  assembly.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  these  institutions  now  hold  up  on  deposit  nearly  seventeen millions of  dollars  of  the people’s money, no degree of  care  in  the  enactment of  laws  regulating  its  investment can be too great. In  this  connection  permit  me  to  refer  to  the  fact  that  the  aggregate  amount  of  deposits,  less  than  fifteen hundred  dollars  each,  held  by  the  savings  banks  and  trust  companies  of  this  state  are  taxed  at  the  rate  of  six-tenths of one per cent per annum, which  is about one-half  the average  rate of  taxation  imposed by  law on  those classes of property embraced in the grand list.  It is probably true that the grand list does not represent all of the taxable property in the state, and some of it may not be listed at its full value, but whether on this account there should  be  such  a wide  difference  in  the  rate  of  taxation  of  the  two  classes  of  property,  is  a  question  for  you  to determine. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. I  have  not  been  able  to  examine  the  report  of  the  board  of  agriculture,  nor  have  I  any  information  as  to  its contents  or  recommendations.    I  am,  therefore,  able  only  to  refer  to  the  fact  that  ours  is  distinctively  an agricultural  state,  and  that  the  general  course  of  legislation  should  be  such  as  to  encourage  the  best  possible work  in  developing  this  industry.    In  a  general  assembly,  such  a  large  proportion  of  which  is  made  up  of farmers,  no  recommendations  of  mine  can  be  necessary  to  inspire  legislation  in  this  direction.    Permit  me  to suggest,  however,  that  as  large  manufactories  operate  to  produce  a  home  market  for  farm  products,  a  policy should  be  adopted  that will  encourage  their  establishment.   We  have  great  natural  advantages which  as  yet  are undeveloped and in which the investments of capital stock should be encouraged by all legitimate means. RAILROADS. Since  the  close  of  the  last  session  of  the  legislature,  the  so-called  inter-state  commerce  law  of  the  United States has been enacted and put  in operation.   The action of  this  law has attracted general attention and excited great public  interest, and  it  is  thought by  those most conversant with  its operation  that  its principles have  found permanent  lodgment  in  the  legislation  of  the  general  government.    There  is  also  a  widespread  feeling  in  our state  that  the  provisions  of  that  law  concerning  the  duties  and  obligations  of  common  carriers  in  their  relations to individuals and to the public should be, so far as is practicable, incorporated into the statute laws of this state, with proper penalties  for  the enforcement of  the  same, and  that enlarged power should be given  to  the board of railroad commissioners in connection therewith.  If, as is claimed, the adoption of such provisions will place all patrons  of  railroads  upon  a  common  footing,  remove  unjust  discriminations  wherever  they  exist,  and  serve  to allay  any  feeling  of  distrust,  founded  or  unfounded,  now  entertained  toward  this  class  of  corporations,  and,  on the other hand, work no injustice to the classes to which they are made to apply, nothing better could be desired in legislation.  The proposition meets my approval. THE BOARD OF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS. The  board  of  railroad  commissioners  has  prepared  an  elaborate  report  concerning  its  work  during  the  first twenty months of its existence, the perusal of which cannot fail to be both interesting and instructive. The board easily realized  that  the  law  laid upon  it “a broader and more varied field of service  than could be fully explored in  any one  term or  touched upon  in  all  its details  in  any one  report,”  and wisely decided not  to undertake more than  it  could  successfully  accomplish.  Much  that  it  has  done  has  been,  necessarily,  some  preliminary  in  its character,  and  has  not  yet  yielded  the  results  that  may  be  expected  at  a  later  time  but  in  the  system  of  returns adopted and in the supervision it has established, the board has laid a foundation upon which, in the future, great results must necessarily  rest. On  the other hand, much has been accomplished  that could not have been done  in the absence of  the board. The report shows  that  in every  instance  in which any  individual feeling aggrieved has applied  for  assistance,  a  speedy  hearing  has  been  granted,  a  determination  reached,  and  the  railroads  have uniformly yielded a ready acquiescence in the recommendations of the board. The  recommendations  that  all  railroad  companies  be  required  by  law  to  heat  their  passenger  coaches  by other  means  than  the  use  of  stoves  or  furnaces,  and  that  the  extension  of  guard  rails,  or  some  other  safety appliance, upon  the  approach of  all bridges be made  compulsory,  are based upon  facts and conclusions elicited by  the most painstaking  investigations,  the report of which will be read with  lively  interest and satisfaction. All other  recommendations  contained  in  the  report  seemed  to  be  based  upon  well  considered  and  well  founded reasons, and should not be overlooked. The record of the past indicates a bright future of usefulness to this board. THE MILITIA. For  information  concerning  the  character,  condition  and  needs  of  the  national  guard  of  Vermont,  you  are referred  to  the  very  interesting  report  of  the  adjutant  and  inspector-general, whose  love  for  the military  branch of  the  state  government  is  only  equaled  by  his  efforts  to  advance  its  efficiency.  You  will  carefully  note  his suggestions and recommendations, and take such action as shall appear to you to be demanded. GETTYSBURG MONUMENTS. It has not been my fortune thus far to participate in the work of patriotism and gratitude for commemorating Vermont  valor  at  Gettysburg,  but,  having  a  deep  interest  in  it,  I  desire  to  speak  approvingly  of  the recommendations of the retiring executive. Vermont  has  never  been wanting  in  devotion  to  her  soldiers,  and  I  believe  it  is  the  desire  of  all  her  people that this work shall go on to completion in such a manner as to reflect the most credit on the state. This is one of the  subjects  upon  which  expense,  within  reasonable  limits,  is  of  comparatively  little  importance,  and  I  am confident  the  Commission  has  exercised  economy  as  well  as  judgment  in  what  it  has  done  or  undertaken.  I recommend that such appropriation be made and such legislation had as will carry out its work and wishes; and, inasmuch  as  my  distinguished  predecessor  was,  by  virtue  of  his  office,  a  member  of  the  commission,  and  as such  has  taken  the  liveliest  interest  in  all  the  details  of  the  work,  I  suggest  such  legislation  as  will  permit  his retention in the commission. VERMONT HISTORICAL SOCIETY. The  Vermont  Historical  Society  in  its  new  quarters  has  a  safe  and  convenient  place  in  which  to  keep  its valuable  collection.  It  has  books  and  papers  that  should  be  bound,  also  many  valuable  documents  and  articles that should be framed or mounted so that they can be seen. A collection of this character draws increase to itself by  being  properly  displayed,  and  it  would  seem  to  be  wise  for  the  state  to  grant  such  an  appropriation  as  will enable  the  society  to  do  the  work  above  indicated.  The  expenditure  required  is  not  large  and  is  directly  in  the line of the preservation, proper use and increase of property of great historical value, and in which the state now has a proprietary interest. PROHIBITORY LIQUOR LAW. During all the time the prohibitory liquor law has been upon our statute books, there have been constant and persistent  efforts  on  the  part  of  its  opponents  to  discover  defects  in  its  provisions  and  to  prevent  its  proper enforcement. The representatives of  the people have on  the other hand, sought  to remedy  its defects, strengthen its character, and improve its effectiveness. As the law now stands it is an exceedingly strong one. Its weakness lies, to a considerable extent, in the difficulty attending its enforcement. The person injured does not, as in other cases, enter complaint, look up evidence, and by his suggestions aid the prosecutor in his work, but by all means in his power, not  infrequently committing  the crime of perjury  so  to do,  shields  the man who has ministered  to his ruin.  Its ineffectiveness has also been increased by a want of support on the part of the public at large. There have been too many who, though at heart friendly to the law, lacked the moral courage to publicly support those who have had  to do with  its enforcement. This class has added weakness  to weakness  in  its unjust criticisms of those who,  deserted  by  friends  and  surrounded  by  foes,  have  in most  cases  performed  their  duty  as well  as  the existing  circumstances  permitted.  Gradually,  however,  a  better  public  sentiment  has  been  developed; prosecuting  officers  feel  the  moral  support  given  jurors  are  strengthened  in  a  spirit  of  independence,  and witnesses begin  to  comprehend  that  in  evasion  and untruth  they  are no  longer  excused, much  less  commended. A  corresponding  weakness  is  noted  on  the  part  of  the  offenders;  in  some  counties  where,  a  few  years  ago, almost  all  charged  with  offences  under  this  law  took  trial,  the  offender  who  now  dares  to  face  a  jury  is  the exception.    The  main  difficulties  are  encountered  in  the  more  populous  villages  where  greater  secrecy  can  be observed and where, when one conviction has been had and a  fine has been  imposed,  the offender  finds  it easy to  place  his  business  in  the  hands  of  another  as  the  ostensible  owner,  and  so  evades  imprisonment  in  case  of  a second or third prosecution. Has  not  the  time  come when  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  should  follow  the  first  conviction  under  this  law, and when a provision of that character would do more to stop sales in the larger villages than any other measure yet  proposed?  I  am  strongly  of  the  opinion  that  it  has;  but  the  subject  is  one  which  by  its  importance  so addresses itself to your patient scrutiny that suggestions are unnecessary. EDUCATION. The  form  and  nature  of  our  government  are  such  that  virtue  and  intelligence  are  not  only  its  foundation stones  but  its walls  of  defence.  It  is  conceded  by  all  that  a  high  development  of  these  qualities  can  only  come with  superior  educational  facilities.  The  framers  of  the  constitution  recognized  this  fact  in  the  provision  that “laws  for  the  encouragement  of  virtue  and  prevention  of  vice  and  immorality,  ought  to  be  constantly  kept  in force,  and  duly  executed  and  a  competent  number  of  schools  ought  to  be  maintained  in  each  town  for  the convenient  instruction  of  youth;  and  one  or more  grammar  schools  be  incorporated  and  properly  supported,  in each county in the state.” The people and  their  representatives have, at all  times, sought  to carry  these provisions  into effect;  the only differences  arising  having  been  those  relating  to  methods  and  systems  rather  than  to  the  ends  sought  to  be accomplished. That  the present district  system  contains  serious defects,  can not be doubted  that  the  common  schools have failed  in  the  character of  their work  to keep  abreast with  the progress of  the  times,  is  admitted by  all observant people. New  methods  have  been  proposed  and  discussed;  the  town  system  has  been  perfected  and  offered  to  the people, only  to be  rejected, and  to-day we  stand  in  the position occupied  ten years ago, with  the district system in force in nearly all the towns of the state, unimproved and full of glaring faults. In  the  proposed  adoption  of  the  town  system,  some  of  our  best  educators  hoped  for  success,  believing  that under  its  provisions  a  better  system  of  supervision  could  be  obtained,  and  that  an  efficient  supervision was  the prime necessity of the hour. That this system has worked admirably in certain places can not be doubted; that it has  failed  in  others,  can  not  be  denied;  that  the  great  majority  of  the  people  prefer  the  district  system  and  are averse to any other, is as plain to my mind as any fact in history can be made. Recognizing  the necessity of solving  this problem  intelligently,  the general assembly of 1886 enacted a  law entitled “An act appointing a committee of  three  to draft a new educational bill, so as  to  increase  the efficiency and improve the public schools of the state,” under which a committee, consisting of Hon. Loveland Munson of Manchester, President Ezra Brainerd of Middlebury college and principal S. W. Landon of  the Burlington high school,  was  appointed.  These  gentlemen  entered  the  work  with  enthusiasm,  and  have  devoted  much  time  and energy  to  the  study  of  the  question,  and  in  devising  a  remedy  for  the  evils  found  to  exist.  The  results  of  their work will be laid before you at an early day; space will not permit a discussion of it in this address, but you will pardon me  in  remarking  that  the  plan  they  propose  commends  itself  to my  judgment  and meets with my warm approval. Upon  the  general  assembly  rests  great  responsibility;  with  it  there  has  come  a  great  opportunity;  parents throughout  the  state  are  looking  to  you  for  action,  and  public  interest  demands  it;  expense  is  not  to  be considered  in  a  question  of  this  importance,  unless  the  amount  required  is  greatly  disproportionate  to  the  end sought.  I am  sure  I need not urge you  to  lay aside all prejudices  in  favor of or against any particular  system, or to  rise  above  any  persona  or  selfish  interest  in  the matter. Your  purity  of  purpose,  your  loyal  love  for  the  best interests  of  our  state,  and  your  appreciation  of  the  absolute  need  there  is  for  reform  in  school  methods,  will surely lead you to vigorous and intelligent action. In  conclusion  permit  me  to  wish  you  a  pleasant  and  harmonious  session,  the  results  of  which  shall  be marked  by  evidence  of  wise  counsels,  mature  consideration,  and  courage  equal  to  all  the  demands  of  public interests. }EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, Montpelier, Vt., October 4, 1888.
