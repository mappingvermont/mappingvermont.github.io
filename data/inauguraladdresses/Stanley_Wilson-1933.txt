Inaugural address of  Stanley C. Wilson    As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1933  Thursday, January 5, 1933 Inaugural Message Members of the General Assembly:-- The people of Vermont have  entrusted  to  us  tasks  that we  have  severally  taken our oaths  to  perform. Some of those tasks are bound to be difficult. But we have pride in our state, we have confidence in the stability of our institutions,  we  have  a  steadfast  faith  in  our  people,  and  as  true  Vermonters  we  shall  not  lack  in  courage  to attack and solve the problems that confront us. It is my first duty to suggest to you such subjects of legislation as seem important for your consideration and to  make  such  recommendations  as  seem  to  me  advisable.  Necessarily  these  suggestions  and  recommendations must  be  briefly  stated,  but  every  facility  will  be  afforded  you  for  such  additional  information  as  you  desire. Yours is the chief responsibility for legislation, but you are entitled to executive aid. In order that you may wisely determine what shall be done, it is essential that you have before you the facts as to what has been done, as well as present conditions. STATE INSTITUTIONS I  am  glad  to  be  able  to  report  to  you  that  our  state  institutions  are  in  excellent  condition.  We  have  no institution that requires any additions, improvements, or extensive repairs during the next biennial term. Under  authority  from  the  last  legislature  a  new  fire  proof  dormitory  for  disturbed  female  patients  was erected  at  the  State  Hospital  for  the  Insane  at  Waterbury.  This  building  is  of  the  most  approved  type  for  the handling  of  that  class  of  patients.  It  was  built,  completed,  and  fully  equipped  within  the  appropriation  of  one hundred  twenty-five  thousand  dollars.  This  building  will  accommodate  one  hundred  patients  and  should  be sufficient to take care of any natural increase in patients at the state hospital for the present. In  this  connection  I  call  your  attention  to  the  fact  that  there  is  a  constantly  growing  tendency  to  secure commitment  to  the state hospital as state patients of people who may perhaps be  technically  insane but who are not  in need of care  in an  institution  for  the  insane. The practice of unloading  town paupers on  the state  through commitments of this sort should be discouraged. By  special  appropriations,  repairs  and  improvements  have  been  made  at  the  Vermont  Sanatorium  at Pittsford and  the Soldiers’ Home at Bennington, and from regular appropriations at the State Prison and. Prison Farm  at  Windsor  and  the  Industrial  School  at  Vergennes.  A  sprinkler  system  for  fire  protection  has  been installed at the Vermont State Hospital for the Insane. Our  institutions  now  raise  a  large  part  of  the  farm  and  garden  produce  for  their  needs  and  the  policy  has been adopted of buying Vermont products. WASHINGTON COUNTY TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAL In accordance with the provisions of No. 182 of the Acts of 1931, duly ratified by the voters of Washington County, the Washington County Tuberculosis Hospital was on the 2nd day of November, 1932, conveyed to the State and is now in charge of the Commissioner of Public Welfare. It is expected that the cost to the state of the maintenance of this institution together with the liquidation of the portion of the bonds assumed will not exceed the amount heretofore paid to the hospital for the care of patients. FISH AND GAME Practically one person out of every  four  in  the  state by procuring a  license  to  fish or hunt contributes  to  the funds provided  for  the  improvement  and protection of  the  fish  and game  resources of  the  state. The  facts  show that the people of the state, as well as an increasing number outside, are interested in our fishing and hunting. Our  fish  and  game  assets  are  of  great  value  not  merely  for  the  sport  furnished  for  the  recreation  of  our people,  but  for  the  actual  commercial  benefit  resulting  to  the  state.    In  the  last  open  season  1992  deer  were reported  lawfully  killed,  which  according  to  prevailing  prices  had  a  commercial  value  of  $48,106.80.  The commercial  value  of  other  game  killed  and  of  the  millions  of  fish  caught  each  year  cannot  be  accurately computed because not reported. During  the  past  two  years  the  Fish  and Game Department  has made  extensive  additions  and  improvements to  its plants  and  equipment  for  the propagation  and  rearing of  fish. The policy has been  adopted of  raising  fish to  at  least  advanced  fingerlings  and  in  some  cases  to  legal  size  before  planting.  This  necessitated  additional hatchery accommodations and equipment and enlargement of the facilities in the rearing stations. A modern  hatchery  has  been  constructed  at  Salisbury.  This  hatchery  is  said  to  be  producing  the  finest  fish ever  raised  in Vermont. Extensive  improvements  have  been made  to  the  hatcheries  at Bennington, Canaan  and Roxbury.  Numerous  rearing  pools  have  been  constructed  with  the  cooperation  of  fish  and  game  clubs throughout the state. By  far  the greater part of  the  funds available  in  this department are now being utilized  for  the actual  raising and distribution of fish and game, while the law- enforcement work has been considerably curtailed At the same time  a  healthy  sentiment  in  favor  of  law  enforcement  has  been  built  up  through  work  with  the  fish  and  game clubs  and  in  other ways. Public  sentiment  in  a  community  in  favor of  enforcement of  law  is of  tremendous  aid to the promotion of fish and game interests. I think real progress has been made during the past two years in this respect. REVISION OF STATUTES At  the  last  session  of  the  General  Assembly  a  revision  of  the  Vermont  statutes  was  authorized.  The preliminary work has been completed and  the proposed  revision  is ready  to be submitted  to you. This work has been  done  at  an  expense  somewhat  less  than  the  amount  appropriated  and  very much  less  than  the  cost  of  the last previous revision. Upon  enactment  of  this  proposed  revision,  provision  should  be  made  for  the  editing  and  printing  of  the revision with such amendments as may be required by legislation of this session. UNEMPLOYMENT AND POOR RELIEF Vermont  has  suffered  from  unemployment  and  consequent  necessity  for  poor  relief  less  than  most  states. This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  we  have  been  immune.  In  1931  I  appointed  a  State  Committee  on unemployment which acted in conjunction with President Hoover’s Unemployment Committee, largely as a fact finding commission and a clearing house for information and suggested relief. In 1932 we effected a coordination of several of  the public  relief and unemployment agencies  including  the above,  the  Mayors  Committee,  the  Share-the-Work  Committee,  the  Red  Cross,  the  Committee  for  Trade Recovery,  and  representatives  of  the  local  overseers  of  the  poor.  The  work  has  been  quietly  organized  and apportioned.  Improved  methods  of  poor  relief  to  avoid  doles,  eliminate  frauds,  spread  work  and  create  new work have been put in operation wherever cooperation could be secured. The  state  itself  through  the  highway  department  and  the  forestry  department  has  aided  materially  in furnishing employment to those in need. PUBLICITY I  believe  in  Vermont.  We  are  all  proud  of  her  agriculture  and  her  industries.  We  are  now  alive  to  the wonderful scenic wealth and opportunities for recreational development which abound in the state. It is useless, however, to hope to attract to Vermont any great number of people either for vacations or permanent residences unless we tell them about the attractions of our state. Two years  ago  the  appropriations  for  publicity work were  somewhat  increased.  I  think  the money has been well  spent and  that Vermont  is  reaping benefits  from  it. These benefits extend all  the way  from  securing out of the  state  customers  for Vermont  farms,  summer  homes,  and  farm  products,  to  a  presentation  of  the  advantages of  Vermont  for  business  and  recreational  purposes.  We  should  continue  our  publicity  work.  The  time  to advertise  is  when  additional  business  is  needed.  Avenues  of  approach  to  the  people  of  other  states  have  been opened which appear to be fruitful in results. Private and commercial organizations have assisted in the work. As governor,  it has been  a pleasure  to  take on  a  considerable  amount  of work  along  publicity  lines.  Insofar as my time and other duties have permitted, I have endeavored to tell the story of Vermont and her beauties, her opportunities  and  her  resources  on  every  occasion  when  it  seemed  proper.  Various  broadcasting  studios  have aided by donation of their facilities. So far as I have been able, I have made use of them. In behalf of the state I now express appreciation of this cooperation. EDUCATION Vermonters  believe  in  education.  They  are  disinclined  to  accept  dictation,  however,  as  to  how  it  shall  be provided. We  are  educating our youth  far better  than we  formerly did. No change  to our  school  laws  should be made which will reduce the efficiency of our schools. I  believe  firmly  that  every  reasonable  aid  should  be  provided  to  give  the  pupils  in  rural  schools  and  debt burdened small towns, educational facilities comparable to those enjoyed by pupils in populous communities. I  feel,  however,  that  our  schools  are  costing  us  unduly  at  the  present  time  in  many  instances.  Towns  are somewhat hampered by state laws in attempts to cut costs. A careful study of existing school laws convinces me that changes can be made that will enable us to reduce expenditures by  the state and by  the  towns without sacrificing efficiency.  I believe  the department of education will cooperate with you to this end. I commend to you a careful study of the school laws and the appropriations based thereon.  Specific suggestions will be made in connection with the budget. BANKS AND BANKING The banking record of Vermont is unique in that during the past two years no bank in the state has closed its doors.  This  record  is  a  strong  testimonial  to  the  stability  of  our  financial  institutions,  the  conservatism  of  our bankers,  and  the  good  sense  of  the  tens  of  thousands  of  our  people  who  own  the  deposits  in  our  banks.  These deposits  amount  to  approximately  $145,000,000  in  state  banks  and  approximately  $50,000,000  in  national banks in the state. Banks are a great benefit to the state and to the communities in which they are located. Our people rely upon them  for  the  protection  of  their  savings,  for  a  convenient  and  safe  medium  for  handling  of  commercial transactions  involving money payments, and for  the credit facilities needed for  the conduct of business. A great part of  the  loans of our banks  are made upon mortgages on  the  farms  and  homes  of  our  own  people.  It  is  to  be remembered, also, that the banks contribute annually over a million dollars to our state treasury in taxes. General  business  conditions  during  the  past  three  years  have  made  it  difficult  for  banks  as  well  as  for individuals. When  individuals, because of reduced earnings, do not have money  to pay  their  loans,  the banks  in turn do not have  those  funds  to  finance other  individuals. So,  the banks may have some slow assets which may be worth full value but cannot be realized upon quickly. In times of depression, it is natural that bank depositors desire  to  draw  upon  their  savings  for  use.  If  the  people  who  owe  the  banks  fail  to  pay  fast  enough  to  supply funds to meet these withdrawals, banks are forced to borrow money to pay their depositors until they can collect on  their  mortgage  loans  on  homes  and  farms.  Throughout  the  country,  due  largely  to  the  present  abnormal conditions, there have been a great many bank failures. Our  bankers  have  been  laboring  with  the  problem  of  adjusting  the  business  of  the  banks  to  changing conditions  in  order  to  perform  their  full  service  without  ill-treating  their  debtors  and  still  supply  the  needs  of their depositors on demand and furnish necessary loans for business and agriculture. Other  states  are  struggling  with  the  same  problems.  In  a  few,  where  legislatures  have  been  in  session, legislative enactments have been made; in many others, legislation is to be proposed, looking to improvement of the  situation. Banking,  like most  business,  is  conducted  upon  the  foundation  of  credit.  It  is,  therefore,  our  duty to  see  to  it  that  the  credit  of  our  Vermont  banks  is  maintained  in  order  that  our  business  may  be  conducted properly. During  the  past  year,  at  my  suggestion,  a  voluntary  organization  was  formed  which  includes  in  its membership  eighty  per  cent  of  all  the  banks  in  the  state,  representing  ninety  per  cent  of  all  the  bank  deposits. This  organization,  known  as  the  Vermont  Bankers  State  Committee,  has  created  a  central  fund  under  a cooperative loan plan for the mutual protection of all. It has helped to stabilize credit conditions. This  organization  is  temporary  and  voluntary,  however,  and  legislation  will  be  necessary  to  safeguard permanently  the  interests of our banks, and when  I  say banks,  I have  in mind especially  the depositors who are the people having  the greatest  interest, as well as  the  stockholders and  the business men and  farmers and home owners who borrow from the banks. It is essential to the welfare of the state that every reasonable effort shall be made  to  keep  our  financial  institutions  not  merely  sound,  but  able  to  perform  their  proper  functions  in  their communities. The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance has made an extensive study of present conditions, As a result, there  will  be  presented  to  you  proposed  changes  which  he  deems  advisable  to  be  made  in  the  investment  and administrative provisions of our banking laws. I trust these will be given your careful consideration. I  believe  that  the  situation  requires  something more  than  routine  action, You  should  go  further  and  provide legislation  to guard against contingencies  that may arise  in  the  future  similar  to  that which  is being provided  in other states and which may be  termed emergency  legislation.  In  some  states,  the compulsory creation of a  joint fund, contributed to by all banks and for the use of banks in temporary need of cash, has been provided by law. In  others,  legal  status  has  been  given  to  such  a  fund  created  on  a  voluntary  basis.  These  are  worthy  of  your consideration. I deem our banking laws inadequate also in the matter of provisions for reorganizations, consolidations, and mergers. These are  technical matters which I do not care  to discuss  in detail at  this  tune but which I suggest for your careful consideration. In  view  of  the  misfortunes  which  have  come  to  the  banking  institutions  in  many  states  and  the  serious financial  conditions which  prevail  the  country  over, we will  be  derelict  in  our  duty  if we  fail  to  provide  every reasonable safeguard for our banking institutions in order that we may preserve to our people the benefits of the savings and financial genius of generations of Vermonters. HOME LOAN BANKS By  act  of  Congress  Home  Loan  Banks  have  been  created  to  aid  in  the  financing  of  the  construction  of homes.  The  use  of  this  governmental  agency  is  desirable  to  enlarge  the  credit  facilities  of  our  financial institutions and  facilitate  the  return of normal building operations. Building  costs  are now  low  and our  labor  in building  lines  is  in  need  of  employment.  The  contraction  of  ordinary  bank  credits  due  to  the  general  financial stringency has put building operations at a low point. Our  statutes  do  not  permit  our Vermont  institutions  to  take  advantage  of  the  provisions  of  the Home  Loan Bank.  I  recommend  that you provide proper  legislation  to  enable  them  to do  so  and  so  release  additional  funds for  the use of people who desire  to build homes. Every dollar we can put  in circulation  for useful purposes will aid the general public ERADICATION OF BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS Agriculture  is  the basic  industry of Vermont. For many years Vermont has been committed  to  the policy of eradicating bovine  tuberculosis  through cooperation between  the state government and federal government. We began  with  the  accredited  herd  plan  in  1917  and  inaugurated  work  by  areas  in  1925.  At  the  present  time  113 towns  have  been  area  tested.  Ninety-three  of  these  are  officially  modified  accredited  tuberculosis  free  areas. One hundred thirty-five towns have not been area tested, of which 107 are already signed up for the test. The  last  legislature  recognized an emergency and provided an  increase  in  appropriations  for  this work. The emergency is greater now. If  we  continue  the  work  by  appropriating  $250,000  a  year,  as  we  are  now  doing,  the  work  will  not  be completed  until  1937  and  the  estimated  cost  would  be  $865,000.  The  federal  government  will  cooperate  with their  part  of  indemnity  payments  up  to  July  1,  1934.  We  have  no  assurance  of  federal  appropriations  beyond that date. Our dairymen are  threatened with  loss of markets  for  their milk unless  their herds are  tuberculin  tested, and this threat is especially serious because our neighboring states are finishing their work along these lines. Very carefully revised estimates satisfy me that if funds are provided, the initial area tests can be completed before July 1, 1934 at a considerably lower cost than if the work is extended over three additional years. A plan has  been  worked  out  whereby  we  can  provide  funds  and  take  care  of  the  expenditures  within  the  coming biennial period. The appraisals on cows are now low and the dairy industry needs the immediate relief. I recommend for your careful consideration the plan which will soon be presented to you. FORESTRY Interest  in  forestry  continues  despite  economic  conditions.  During  the  past  two  years  2,193,400  trees  were planted  in  the state  in private  lands, municipal forests and state forests. Five  thousand seven hundred four acres were  added  to  our  state  forests  and  state  forest  parks,  making  a  total  of  44,207  acres.  There  have  been  three splendid gifts during  this  time. The Thetford Hill State Forest, 260 acres, was a gift from Mr. Dwight Goddard. Mr. Walter  K.  Barrows  gave  12  acres  in  the  Gifford Woods  in  Sherburne,  and  Mr. Wallace  I.  Allis  gave  135 acres on Bear Hill in Brookfield. The latter tract is now a scenic resort visited by many thousands of people last summer. At the present time several hundred men are employed cutting wood and logs on state and municipal forests. On  state  forests  the  Commissioner  of  Forestry  has  arranged  with  overseers  of  the  poor  to  give  wood  to  the unemployed in return for labor culling the forest growth. MOTOR TRUCKS The  problem  of  heavy  trucks  on  our  highways  is  serious.  I  suggest  for  your  consideration  the  further regulation of  the use of  these  trucks and especially  those coming  into Vermont  from other  states, as well as  the question  of  load  limits  and  the  adjustment  of  registration  fees  on  the  basis  of  weights  including  actual  load carried. HIGHWAYS Highways are essential to the business life of our state. The almost universal use of the automobile has made it  necessary  to  build  roads  better  in  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  present  day  traffic.  Engineers  and  road builders are constantly improving well-known types of construction as well as developing new types adapted to changing conditions and at reduced costs. The present problem in Vermont is to make our roads usable the year around and to get our people out of the mud and dust as fast as possible with funds available. The  last  legislature  wisely  provided  for  the  state  taking  over  the  entire  care  of  our  federal  aid  roads.  The action  was  taken  so  late  that  we  did  not  get  full  benefits  in  1931,  but  in  1932  the  beneficial  results  have  been manifest. The state has an added burden but  the gain  in efficiency and  in satisfaction  to  the  traveling public has fully justified the change. We now have 1013 miles state roads, 3387 miles state aid roads, and 9952 miles town roads. During  the  calendar  year  1931  the  state constructed on  state  and  state  aid  roads 32 miles of  cement  surface roads,  21  miles  of  macadam  and  125  miles  of  mixed-in-place  and  surface  treated,  or  a  total  of  178  miles  of modern  surfaced  road.  During  the  year  1932  the  state  built  31  miles  of  cement,  29  miles  of  macadam  and  96 miles  of  mixed-in-place  and  surface  treated.  In  addition  to  this,  there  were  constructed  92  miles  of  gravel surfaced  road  in  1931  and  about  75  miles  in  1932.  These  figures  rate  certain  roads  as  macadam  that  formerly were put in the lower classification, the change of classification having been made to accord with the practice in other states. Some old style surface treated road surfaces were improved. In  1932,  due  to  unemployment  conditions much  construction was done by hand  labor  and on  force  account in order that as many as possible of our people could be kept at work. Some of this work is still in progress. The  federal  government  for  unemployment  relief  advanced  to  be  used  before  next  July  an  additional $600,000 to be used only on federal roads. This has to be used under special regulations which according to our experience  greatly  reduce  its  value  to  us  in  construction  results.  State  funds  spent  under  our  own  regulations have produced better results both in accomplishment and unemployment relief. We  now  have  on  our  entire  road  system  of  14,352  miles,  352  miles  cement,  154  miles  macadam,  2  miles granite block  and other  types  of  pavement,  and  597 miles mixed-in-place  and  surface  treated. Of  these modern surfaced  roads  the  distribution  is  as  follows:  state  roads,  663 miles;  state  aid  roads,  295 miles;  town  roads  147 miles. There has been no complete data on town road work until recently, or since all roads were re-measured in 1931.  Base  work  has  been  done  or  is  in  process  for  at  least  37  miles  additional  of  cement  or  other  improved surfaced roads. I  believe  that  during  the  next  two  years  we  should  decrease  our  high  type  construction  on  state  roads  and increase  our  lower  type  construction  of  improved  surfaced  roads  on  our  state  aid  roads. We  have  few miles  of state  road  requiring  immediate  improvement of high  type construction and we have a  large mileage of  state aid roads  needing  modern  surface.  The  construction  of  bituminous  surfaced  roads  will  afford  much  greater unemployment relief and give more extended mileage. Not only should we get out of the mud as fast as we can, but we  should  put  as many  people  at work  as  possible,  consistent with  efficiency. We  should  not  decrease  the amount of state aid to town roads. EXPLOSION AT POWDER HOUSE On  the  evening  of  August  1,  1932  there  was  an  explosion  of  dynamite  and  other  explosives  stored  by  the Highway Department  near  the State Garage  in  the  town  of Berlin  causing  damage  to  persons  and  property. On the following day preliminary survey of  the damage and investigation of  the cause of  the explosion were made. The explosion resulted from fire of undetermined origin. On August 3 a meeting of  the Emergency Board was held upon my call, and upon considering reports from the Highway Department,  the Attorney General,  and  State Detective,  an  appropriation  of  not  to  exceed  twenty thousand dollars was made  for  the purpose of paying  such damages  to persons  and property  as were  caused by the explosion. The adjustment of claims was handled by the Highway Department. All  claims  have  been  adjusted  and  paid  except  a  few  property  claims  which  were  disallowed,  and  one personal injury claim which is unsettled because of continuing treatment of the injured person. The total sum paid for damages and administration expense is $12,740.74. All claims were personally inspected, and settlements made appear to have been satisfactory. TAXATION GENERALLY I  am  opposed  to  an  increase  in  taxes.  We  have  succeeded  in  relieving  our  grand  list  from  all  direct  state taxes. All  taxes,  however, whether  direct  or  indirect  and whatever  the  immediate  source  are  ultimately  paid  by the  public.  State  taxes  should  be  reduced  if  it  is  possible  to  do  so  and  care  for  the  endeavors  of  the  state  that must be continued or which should be continued because of the benefits which they give to our people. INCOME TAX The income and franchise tax law enacted by the last legislature has had a year of operation. The taxes paid in 1932 were based on the incomes of 1931, a time of great business depression, yet the receipts from the tax for the year were $685,935.73. In  revenue  production  for  the  state,  the  law  has  been  a  success,  considering  the  unfavorable  times. Administration costs have been below all estimates. As is to be expected with a new law of such importance, minor amendments in administrative features seem desirable.  I believe  the  law  should be  continued  in  force with  such  amendments  as  experience  has  shown  to  be needed. This  law  has  enabled  us  to  do  away  with  all  direct  state  taxes  based  on  the  grand  list  of  the  towns,  a  very material measure of direct  relief  to  real estate and  tangible personal property, which has been bearing an unjust proportion of the burdens of taxation. TAXATION OF ELECTRIC POWER COMPANIES The  first year of operation of  the new  law providing  a  tax on  electric  energy generated  in  the  state has  also been  successful.  The  taxes  collected  were  $239,154.00,  or  an  average  of  about  $20,000  a  month.  The  cost  of collection has been small. The tax has not been passed on to the consumers through increased rates. A  commission  appointed  under  authority  of  the  last  legislature  to  examine  into  the  general  subject  of taxation  of  public  utility  companies  engaged  in  the  generation  of  electricity  has  filed  a  report  making  three recommendations. They recommend that the tax be continued in force. In this conclusion I concur. They  further  recommend  two  changes  in  the  law  —  (l)  that  these  corporations  be  exempt  from  franchise taxes, and (2) that a different basis of deductions or credits be provided. The report will be submitted to you. SALARIES OF STATE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES Referring  to  the  compensation  of  state  officers  and  employees,  Section  57  of  the  Constitution  of  Vermont provides as follows: *****“If  any  man  is  called  into  public  service  to  the  prejudice  of  his  private affairs,  he  has  a  right  to  a  reasonable  compensation;  and  whenever  an  office through  increase of  fees or otherwise, becomes  so profitable  as  to occasion many to apply for it, the profit ought to be lessened by the Legislature.” It  has  seemed  to me  that  the  subject  of  decrease  in  salaries  of  state  officers  and  employees  should  be  dealt with by  the  legislature  since  a great many of  the  salaries  are  fixed by  statute,  and  the  legislature may of course fix the salary or wages of any employee. Assuming  that  you  will  desire  to  consider  the  question  of  a  revision  of  salaries,  I  have  requested  the Commissioner  of  Finance  to  prepare,  classify,  and  tabulate  information  on  this  subject  to  assist  you  in  your deliberations. Vermont  state  officials  and  employees,  as  a  rule,  are  not  overpaid.  Most  of  our  officials  in  positions  of responsibility  are  underpaid  as  compared  with  compensation  of  individuals  in  similar  positions  in  other  states and in private business.   It  is  only  because  of  business  conditions  and  the  fact  that many  people  are  getting  reductions  in  pay,  that  a general reduction in state salaries and wages may be justified. I think that, because of existing conditions, salaries should be reduced. I feel, however, that the maintenance of a proper standard of living requires an exemption of one thousand dollars. A flat reduction of ten per cent on all  salaries,  after  allowing  such  exemption,  would,  I  think,  be  reasonably  fair,  with  a  corresponding  reduction for officials and employees paid on per diem basis when  such per diems are at a  rate commensurate  to a  salary above one thousand dollars per year. If  after  investigation  you  deem  salaries  and  other  compensation  should  be  reduced,  feel  sure  state  officers and employees will accept the reductions in a patriotic spirit. In  case  there  is  a  reduction  of  salaries,  authority  should  be  given  to  the  Commissioner  of  Finance  or  other officials  to  work  out  and  adjust  the  salaries  in  accordance  with  the  plan  outlined  by  the  legislature.  If  a  salary reduction is made, corresponding changes should be made in departmental appropriations. COST OF GOVERNMENT The  net  adjusted  cost  of  state  government  has  been  tabulated  by  the  auditor  of  accounts  for  the  last  thirty-two fiscal years.   The tabulation shows expenditures for each main endeavor of our state government as well as totals.  This  tabulation  deserves  your  study.  You  should  consider,  however,  the  causes  of  the  changes.  You should  also  bear  in  mind  that  these  figures  do  not  distinguish  the  portion  of  expenditures  paid  for  through appropriations from state revenues which in many instances are much less.  All  expenditures  to  be  made  from  state  funds  must  be  specifically  appropriated.  The  state  is  the  agency, however,  for  the  expenditure  of  various  sums  that  do  not  come  through  state  taxation,  as  for  instance  highway funds and other funds coming from the federal government and the income from trust funds.  The  tabulation  shows  that  the  cost  of  government  from  about  a  million  dollars  in  1901  increased  nearly every  year  until  it  reached  its  crest  in  1929,  when  we  had  our  heaviest  expenditures  due  to  the  flood  of  1927. The cost has decreased from that time, as follows:  For year ending June 30, 1929. .....................$16,776,302.71 For year ending June 30, 1930. .....................$13,447,335.57 For year ending June 30, 1931. .....................$12,006,221.90 For year ending June 30, 1932. .....................$11,040,634.44 The  net  cost  of  government  during  the  last  fiscal  year  was  reduced  from  that  of  the  previous  year  by $965,587.46  and  from  that  of  the  high  year  of  1929  by  $5,735,668.27. We  have  no  reason  to  be  discouraged, therefore, while we seek to make further reductions. The  great  increase  in  the  cost  of  our  government  aside  from  war  time  expenditures  and  those  due  to  the flood has come about because  the people acting  through  their representatives  in previous  legislatures have been constantly demanding that more be done for them through state agencies. We speak of essentials of government. The  actual  essentials  of  state  government  are  few.  Not  long  ago  the  state  spent  nothing  for  highways,  public health,  care  of  the  insane,  care  of  tubercular  persons,  public  welfare,  conservation,  agriculture,  forestry, industries,  and  supervision  of  public  service  corporations  and  but  little  for  education  and  debt  service.  If  we should eliminate expenditures for these endeavors now, we could run state government for a tenth of its present cost. For  practical  purposes we must  now  define  the  essentials  of  state  government  to  be  those  endeavors which are  either  necessary  for  the  continuance  of  the  constitutional  functions  of  the  state  or  which  may  properly  be handled by  the  state and which  the people had  rather pay  for and have  the  state carry on  than  to go without  the service or provide for it through local taxes. I  believe  governmental  costs  should  be  reduced.  I  believe  the  cost  of  town  and  city  government  should  be reduced.  To  shift  burdens  from  the  towns  to  the  state  does  not  relieve  the  burden  of  taxation,  although  it  may effect a different distribution of that burden and may secure greater efficiency. To cut off a state endeavor that is deemed essential will not relieve the burden, it will simply cast it on the several communities. Probably  we  have  no  state  endeavors  that  do  not  have  merit.  Some  are  absolutely  essential  to  the continuance  of  our  functioning  as  a  state.  Others  are  essential  according  to  modern  standards.  Some  are desirable only if we can afford them. We must reduce our expenditures both state and local to reduce taxes. State  revenues  were  decreasing  in  1932,  but  with  the  cooperation  of  department  heads  and  employees,  we managed  to keep state expenditures not merely within  the appropriations but approximately $300,000.00 below them  after  making  allowance  for  balances  carried  forward  because  of  commitments  such  as  highway construction  which  has  to  be  conducted  on  a  seasonal  basis.  The  state  paid  its  bills  for  the  year  from  current revenues, and at the same time paid the interest and $472,000.00 of the principal on our bonded debt. STATE FINANCES It  is estimated  that  state  revenues  for  the pending  fiscal year may not be quite  sufficient  to prevent a deficit even  with  continued  and  increased  economies,  due  to  the  fact  that  appropriations  have  entailed  commitments that  cannot  well  be  avoided.    I  assure  you,  however,  that  we  shall  endeavor  to  keep  down  the  departmental expenditures wherever feasible under the law, and I believe the deficit, if any, will be small. On  the  basis  of  existing  laws,  the  revenues  of  the  state  available  for  the  payment  of  appropriations  are estimated  to  be  $8,196,730.00  for  1934,  and  $8,149,730.00  for  1935.  The  appropriations  made  by  the  1931 legislature were 9,373,272.53  for  the period up  to June 30, 1932,  including $173,665.81 provided  for advanced use in 1931, and for 1933 they were $9,392,977.70. It  is  plain  to  be  seen,  therefore,  that with  estimated  annual  revenues more  than  a million  dollars  below  the annual appropriations for the pending biennial period, we must reduce expenditures to balance the budget. THE STATE BUDGET Having these facts in mind, I have in preparation a state budget which will soon be presented to you for your consideration.  It  is  prepared  on  the  basis  of  existing  laws  except  that  in  some  instances  recommendations  for reduced  appropriations  are  made  which  may  require  amendments  to  statutes  and  which  amendments  are suggested. Other suggestions are made as to changes which if adopted will effect further reductions. No  department  of  state  government  has  been  immune  from  reduction  in  appropriation.    The  percentage  of reduction has varied considerably according  to  the nature of  the appropriation.  It  is, of course, more difficult  to reduce  the cost of an endeavor,  the performance of which  is required by  law and  the scope of which  is fixed by conditions over which we have no control,  than  to reduce an appropriation for an endeavor,  the extent of which is measured only by the funds available. The  budget  makes  no  allowance  for  any  special  appropriations.  No  special  appropriations  should  be  made unless the same are clearly founded upon necessity. If additional appropriations are made, it will be necessary to provide additional revenue. The  budget  eliminates  all  appropriations  for  construction  of  new  buildings  or  unusual  repairs  of  present buildings. I  recommend  that  from  the  revenues  received  from  motor  vehicle  registrations  and  fees  and  gasoline  tax there be deducted the following: the annual payment on flood bonds, the interest on flood bonds, and the cost of operation of the Motor Vehicle Department; and that only the remainder, after these deductions, be appropriated for  highway  purposes.  These  deductions  amount  to  approximately  $800,000  per  year.  I  am  therefore recommending  that  appropriations  for  highways  be  greatly  reduced  from  the  appropriations  for  the  pending biennial  years.  I  dislike  to  make  this  recommendation,  especially  in  view  of  the  fact  that  there  is  a  likelihood federal  appropriations  for  highway  purposes  may  be  reduced  or  cut  off,  and  we  need  the  work  for  our unemployed. In  the  Department  of  Education,  I  recommend  reductions  on  several  items  —  elimination  of  one  deputy commissioner,  reduction  of  appropriations  for  superintendents,  and  changes  of  basis  of  state  aid  of  several kinds. The changes are designed to curb the tendency to higher school taxes in the towns, as well as save money for the state. I recommend the repeal of the statutes providing bounties for destruction of noxious animals. In the Judiciary Department I recommend several changes in statutes and the elimination of certain courts to bring about reductions in expense. Provision  is made  for  caring  for  the  emergency  confronting  agriculture  in  the matter of bovine  tuberculosis eradication. The recommended appropriations  in  the budget are within  the estimated  income. In other words,  the budget will balance. CONCLUSION Your work as legislators is especially important this session. Legislative action will be watched this year by the people as seldom before. These times of depression have brought forth a multitude of radical suggestions the country over. You will doubtless have some presented to you. From  the days when  the Green Mountain Boys set up an  independent nation more  than a century and a half ago  Vermont  and  Vermonters  have  stood  for  independent  thought  and  action  and  for  progress  along conservative  lines.  It  is your business  to see  that Vermont shall  retain her proud position and  in  these  troublous times  lay  the foundation for a new and greater prosperity that  is bound soon  to come. It  is my earnest hope  that we may labor together and accomplish much for our beloved state. STANLEY C. WILSON.
