Inaugural address of  John E. Weeks    As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1927  Thursday, January 6, 1927 Inaugural Message  Mr. President and Members of the Joint Assembly: The meeting of the town, city and county representatives is always an important event in the government of the people of Vermont. The  session of  the Legislature of 1927 will,  I believe, be an historic one, because of  its far-reaching effect on  the progress and development of  the State. Before us are many problems upon which we must pass  judgment. May we pass  this  judgment  fearlessly and  in  sober  thought,  foreseeing, as best we can,  its effect upon the Commonwealth. We have by the franchise been entrusted with the supervision of State affairs for the next biennial term. We should accept these duties as our serious work, actuated by the highest ideals for the welfare of the State and its people. However  high  our motives,  however  ambitious we may  be  to  accomplish, we may  fail  of  our  purposes unless  we  can  lay  aside  personalities  and  prejudices  and  submit  to  the  will  of  the  majority.  Real  co-operation must  at  all  times  prevail  if  we  are  to  realize  our  hopes  for  the  best  and  most  prudent  legislative  action.  If  at times  our  ambitions  and  our  individual  opinions  are  overcome, we may  find  satisfaction  in  the  knowledge  that the judgment of the whole body of the Legislature is wiser than the judgment of any individual member. We must  approach  the  problems which  are  before  us  thinking  in  terms of  real  improvement,  sane progress, sound economy and increased efficiency. We must work together to the end that the best interests of the people of Vermont are at all times furthered and safeguarded. Practical aid to agriculture, advancement of the educational advantages for our boys and girls — particularly in  the  rural  districts —  the  adoption  of  a  definite  policy  for  highway  development,  improvement  of  our  State Institutions  and  responsible  stewardship  of  our  State wards,  forestry  of waste  lands,  increased  publicity  for  the scenic  beauties  and  superior  advantages  of  Vermont,  and  development  of  our  fish  and  game  interests,  are questions which we must seriously consider and with which we must reasonably deal. Wise  economy,  that  is,  the  greatest  degree  of  economy  consistent  with  progress  and  efficiency,  should  be our  constant  aim  in  the  conduct  of  State  business.  Economy  which  impairs  the  efficiency  of  government,  and which curtails essential service and the pursuit of needed activities, is unwise and should not be practiced. AGRICULTURE. Agriculture  is  the  basic  industry  of  Vermont  and  upon  it  depends,  in  large  measure,  the  prosperity  of  the State. The farming situation  in Vermont has shown some  improvement during  the past  two years, but continues to present problems. That of  co-operative marketing  is one of vital  importance  to  the State. The Department of Agriculture  has  already  done  much  to  aid  our  farmers  in  the  marketing  of  their  products.  More  could  be accomplished  if  funds  were  available  to  extend  the  work.  Farmers  can  unquestionably  exercise  effective bargaining  power  through  co-operative  organizations  representing  a  majority  of  the  producers  of  the  crops. They can, by organization, prevent disastrous ups and downs in prices and cause a steady flow of their products to the markets. The  Commissioner  of  Agriculture  should  be  given  a  sufficient  appropriation,  together  with  authority,  to maintain  a distinct department under his  control  to  extend  the  service of co-operative marketing  and  to  enlarge the  scope  of  its  activities,  to  the  end  that  the  individual  farmer  may  benefit  by  higher  and  more  satisfactory prices. AREA TEST OF CATTLE. The  area  test  of  cattle  should  be  continued with  an  increased  appropriation  and  a  larger  field  of  usefulness, as it is of the greatest value and importance to the State. EDUCATION. Vermont  ranks high  in  intelligence  and  leadership  among  the  states  of  the Union. To  thoroughness  in  early school  training  we  must  attribute,  in  large  measure,  our  enviable  position.  We  have  made  progress educationally,  and  I  believe  that  under  the  school  system  that  has  prevailed,  excellent  work  has  been  done  in furthering efficiency and standardization. To provide better rural schools, schools with better buildings, better equipment and better surroundings, and supplied  with  capable,  trained  teachers,  is  a  task  immediately  confronting  us.  Influences  which  improve conditions of work in the rural schools, or which promote interest in those schools, have a beneficial effect upon the welfare of our communities. The Constitution of Vermont  from  the days of  the  independent State  republic  to now has contained  the  first principle  of  a  sound  educational  policy:  “A  competent  number  of  schools  ought  to  be maintained  in  each  town for the convenient instruction of youth.” From  that declaration of principle, adopted by  the people before Vermont became a State, we cannot  safely depart.  The  fathers  emphasized  both  an  adequate  number  of  schools  and  their  location  convenient  to  the children.  They  knew  Vermont,  its  narrow  winding  valleys  compelling  a  scattered  population,  and  its  rugged climate. God  gave  us  our mountains,  and with  them He  gave  us  school  problems which must  be  solved  in  our way with our own good sense. We have, I believe, drifted away from the Constitution in abandonment of school centers for the convenient instruction  of  youth.  A  community  which  has  lost  its  school  is  likely  to  lose  also  its  spirit  and  its  pride. Abandoned  school  houses mean  abandoned  farms.  It  is  yet  to  be  proved  that  children who  are  forced  to  spend hours  a  day  riding  to  a  larger  school  receive  a  better  education  or  turn  to  be  stronger  men  and  women  than children  who  attend  smaller  schools  near  their  own  homes.  It  is  not  the  size  of  the  building  or  the  number  of grades that makes a good school, but the kind of teaching that is done in it. With a devoted teacher — and there are  many  such  in  Vermont  —  there  is  no  better  place  for  a  start  in  education  than  the  neighborhood  school fostered by  the  local community. School taxes are paid more willingly when  the money  is spent nearby and not to  build  up  the  institutions  of  a  larger  center.  The  loyalty  of  a  neighborhood  to  its  school,  and  pride  in  the attainment  of  the  children,  are  more  stimulative  to  excellence  than  the  most  skilled  supervision  can  be.  The financial  assistance  of  the  State  should  be  brought  as  near  as  possible  to  the  children,  and  that  means  higher wages to the teachers, especially in the more scattered districts where the burden is naturally heaviest. In  educational matters  especially  we  can  well  afford  to  respect  the  principle  of  local  self-government.  The people  of  Vermont  can  be  trusted  to  provide  for  the  education  of  their  children.  Let  us  foster  the  local  school and  help  every  school  district  where  there  is  a  sufficient  number  of  pupils  to  keep  its  school  and  to  make  it  a good school. Money, spent in repairing the school houses and making them neat and the grounds attractive, will pay better dividends in education than money spent on transportation busses, and at the same time it will tend to keep  up  the  population  in  the  rural  districts,  which  is  of  the  utmost  importance  for  the  general  welfare  of Vermont. HIGHWAYS. It must be plain to all of us who have followed the public discussion of the State issues for the past year that the  question  of  better  highways  is  one  of  the  greatest  importance.    Highways  are  the  only  means  of communication between many rural towns and are increasingly important to all residents of the State, as well as to  the  tourists  and  visitors  who  come  to  us  in  greatly  increased  numbers  during  the  summer  season.  For  the necessary and convenient purposes of daily use, as a public investment and as a means of attracting visitors who may become permanent residents, good roads are no longer a luxury but a necessity. In  considering  the matter  of  highways,  we must  not  let  the  “much”  there  is  to  do  obscure  the  “much”  that has  been  done.  We  have  made  material  progress  in  our  highway  development  during  the  past  few  years,  and credit  should  be  given  the  highway  department  for  the  steady  improvement  that  has  been  made.  We  have accomplished much,  for we  have  laid  the  foundation  for  an  adequate  and  improved  system  of  highways  in  our State. Few  of  us  realize,  however,  that  a  revolution  has  taken  place  in  our  system  of  transportation  as  applied  to highways  during  the  past  twenty  years.  The  number  of motor  vehicles  in  this  country  has  increased  during  the past  ten  years  from  2,500,000  to  20,000,000  and  in  Vermont  from  15,671  to  73,946.  In  contemplating  the future,  I  am  impressed  with  the  necessity  of  making  adequate  provision  for  the  increasing  service  that  will  be expected  of  the  highways  in  the  State.  The  highway  service we  provide must  be  capable  of  expansion  to meet the needs of growing traffic. First  of  all,  good  roads  are  a  necessity  to  our  farmers,  and  no  plan  of  road-building  should  overlook  the urgent needs of the farmers and others who live off the main lines of travel. These residents and taxpayers are as much entitled  to a passable  road  to  their markets as  those on  the  trunk  lines where  the  traffic  is greater, and we should  consider  the  necessity  of  providing  them  with  better  roads.  Under  any  plan  of  improvement,  provision should  be  made  for  the  development  of  our  system  of  so-called  back  roads,  by  leaving  intact  funds  now available from present revenues for such development. Experience  has  shown,  however,  that  while  gravel  as  road-building  material  is  usually  adequate  for  roads where  the  traffic  runs  below  1,000  cars  a  day,  the  cost  of  maintaining  roads  where  traffic  may  run  as  high  as 2,000 cars or more a day is so great that some more durable surface is plainly indicated. We  should,  therefore,  also  consider  it  good  business  and  a  profitable  public  investment  to  build  as  many miles of hard-surfaced  road as possible each year, situated where  the  traffic survey shows  the heaviest  travel or where the cost of maintaining gravel roads is so high as to make hard-surfaced roads good economy and a good business investment. The  number  of  miles  of  such  road  which  we  should  undertake  to  construct  in  a  year  is  entirely  for  you, members of the House and Senate, to decide. You alone, under the Constitution have the authority to levy taxes, and without  the  necessary  revenue,  no  extended  program  of  road-building  is  possible.  If,  therefore,  you  should see fit to authorize a system of better roads between the rural towns and their markets, and additional mileage of hard-surfaced  roads  on  the main  arteries  of  travel,  you  will,  of  course,  provide  the  necessary  revenue  for  such purposes. It  is not for me  to say how  this revenue shall be provided or how many miles of hard-surfaced road shall be built each year, but it is proper to lay before you the results of my own investigations and refer you to the report of the highway department. From  the most recent records  it appeals that  the average cost of building a mile of paved road in concrete is $45,659.43,  and  in  bituminous macadam  $33,630.23. The  gross  revenues  of  the  highway  department  are  about $2,726,477.12  per  year  under  the  present  scale  of  taxation  and  revenue,  and  these  revenues  are  distributed  in highway appropriations as follows: HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT APPROPRIATIONS AND RECEIPTS AVAILABLE FOR WORK OF 1925. (1)  Five Per Cent Fund Apportionments .........................................................  $ 144,476.37 (2)  State  Aid  Construction  for  aid  to  Towns  in  improvement  of Selected High ways. .............................................................................................................. (3)  State Aid Bridge Fund for aid to Towns in building or   rebuilding bridges on Selected Highways ..................................................... (4) Maintenance, Dust-laying, etc. ...................................................................... (5)  Unselected Highway Fund ............................................................................. (6)  Federal Aid Appropriation by State of Vermont ........................................... (7)  Federal Aid Apportionment by U.S. Government  ........................................ (8)  Supervision and Engineering  ........................................................................ (9)  State Machinery Receipts  .............................................................................   75,000.00    1,075,000.00 250,000.00  400,000.00   365,025.27 100,000.00   116,375.48 -------------------- TOTAL           2,726,477.12 Items 1, 2, and 3, are available for paved road construction only to a limited extent. The Statutes make these funds available to each town in the State, and it is only by special agreement with towns interested that they can be turned in to cover a part of the cost of an extended hard-surfaced project. 200,000.00 Items 4, 5, 8, and 9 are not available for paved road construction from the nature of the appropriations. Items 6 and 7 are available  for whatever  type of construction work on  the Federal Highway System may be agreed upon between the State and the Federal Government. Under  such  plan  of  distribution  approximately  $2,282,326.78  has  actually  been  expended  for  so-called permanent  roads  in  the  past  two  years,  and  about  43.3  miles  of  such  highway  constructed,  or  is  nearing completion.  This,  however,  includes  16.4  miles  of  standard  gravel,  and  about  $500,000.00  of  this  amount  has been expended on bridges. To  raise  the  total mileage of paved  roads  to 40 miles per year would  represent,  therefore, a very  substantial increase, but  inasmuch as  this seems  to meet with  the approval of a majority of our fellow citizens, I,  therefore, recommend the same to your attention. An  estimate  of  funds  from  revenues  now  available  for  permanent  road  construction  indicates  that  there  is annually at the disposal of the highway department approximately the following: Federal aid allotment........................................................................................................  $365,625.27 Federal aid appropriation by State of Vermont................................................................ 400,000.00 Total estimated revenues available for transfer from  registration fees and gas tax  ................................................................................... 520,979.54 That  is,  from  present  revenues  there  is  available  approximately  $1,286,604.81  for  permanent  construction, including bridges, on our trunk lines. As  to  the  proper method  of  raising  the  necessary  revenue  for  the  construction  of  40 miles  of  hard-surfaced road  each  year,  the  so-called  gasoline  tax  has  so  far  proved  most  equitable  and  is  collectible  with  the  least trouble  and  expense.  Under  the  present  tax  of  two  cents  per  gallon,  the  gross  revenue  for  1926  will  be  about $515,000.  An  increase  of  one  cent  per  gallon  would  produce  by  estimate  $260,000  in,  1927  and  a  further increase in 1928. This, however, would fall short of the necessary revenue and unless a careful examination of the budget can suggest to you substantial savings, or unless some additional source of revenue can be developed, the alternative seems  to  be  a  direct  State  tax  of  not over  ten  cents  on  the  dollar  of  the  grand  lists  of  the  State. A  direct  tax  on the  grand  lists  would  yield  annually  about  $287,596.81,  making  a  total  of  funds  available  for  paved  road construction  and  bridges  each  year  about  $1,834,201.62.  The method  should  allow  the  construction  of  at  least 40 miles  of  hard-surfaced  road  or  concrete  and  bituminous macadam  each  year,  and  still  provide  revenues  for necessary bridge construction. Inasmuch as the use of gasoline as a power fuel on the farm and elsewhere is steadily increasing, it might be well  if  some  practical  plan  were  devised  whereby  the  users  of  gasoline  for  purposes  other  than  propelling vehicles  on  the  highway  would  be  relieved  from  paying  a  tax  thereon,  either  by  suitably  safeguarded  rebates, payable on certificate of the Secretary of State, or by some other method of refund. It is obvious that a highway tax  on  gasoline  is  not  properly  collectible  on  fuel  consumed  for  agricultural,  manufacturing  or  domestic purposes. Provision,  also,  should  be  made  to  secure  revenue  by  means  of  license  fees  or  otherwise  from  trucks  and busses  bearing  the  license  plates  of  other  states.  Such  vehicles  place  heavy  burdens  upon  our  roads,  especially in the spring and fall seasons because of their excessive weight. The  small  State  tax works  no  hardship.  It would  fall  equitably  on  all  classes  of  taxpayers,  all  of whom  are benefited  by  good  roads,  but  all  of  whom  do  not  contribute  to  the  proceeds  of  the  gasoline  tax.  I,  therefore, recommend this plan of revenue for your consideration. While  highways  are  being  constructed  for  the  better  accommodation  of  motor  vehicle  traffic,  both  foreign and  domestic, we  should  not  curtail  our watchfulness  over  the  safety  of  those who  use  these  highways  or  lose sight  of  the  fact  that  improved  highways  enhance  the  danger  of  travel  through  inviting  greater  speed.  It  is  a constitutional duty resting upon  the State to protect its people  in  life,  limb and property, against violators of  the law. This  also  applies  to  the  automobile  laws  and  regulations. The  State  should  continue  to  enforce  such  laws, and  the  increased number of automobiles calls  for  increased vigilance and activity on  the part of State officers. Such authority and means as may be necessary to a safe and reasonable use of our highways should be provided by the Legislature. STATE INSTITUTIONS. I believe the most thoughtful attention should be given the delinquent, the feeble-minded and the dependent insane. We cannot curtail the appropriations for the improvement or maintenance costs of the Institutions which house  the  unfortunates  of  the  State,  for  any  scheme  of  economy  which  adds  to  the misery  of  the  wards  of  the Commonwealth is one which the people of Vermont, in honor to themselves, must not countenance. The Legislature  of  1925  by Act No.  19,  Section  41,  gave  the Commissioner  of  Public Welfare  authority  to establish  Colony  homes  for  the  feeble-minded  to  be  managed  and  placed  under  the  control  of  Dr.  T.  J.  Allen. One  such  school  was  established  in  the  city  of  Rutland  in May,  1925,  with  accommodations  for  sixteen  girls. This  venture,  with  the  co-operation  of  the  people  of  the  city  of  Rutland,  has  proved  a  success,  and  today  it  is practically  self-supporting,  other  than  the  expense  of  the  rent  of  the  home.  Only  a  small  percentage  of  the inmates  can  be  thus  selected  so  that  the  school  at  Brandon  is  not  relieved  in  proportion  to  the  applications  for admission that are now on file. If the Institution at Brandon is to qualify under the law as passed in 1912, added accommodations should be considered,  as  I  believe  that  segregation  is  the  only  safe  remedy  in  considering  the  problem  of  the  mentally deficient. I,  therefore,  recommend  for  your  consideration  the  advisability  of  such  increased  accommodations  as  will allow  a  continuance  of  this  important  work.  I  also  advise  the  installation  of  a  refrigeration  plant  at  the  State Industrial School, believing that it will prove an economical proposition for the State and for the Institution. PAROLE OF PRISONERS. The  responsibility  for  the  parole  or  discharge  of  prisoner  should  not  rest  wholly  upon  the  Governor.  Our present  system  prevails  by  authority  of  the  Constitution,  but  I  believe  that  this  Legislature  should  consider  the question of paroles, and, if possible, authorize an advisory council composed of three citizens, with the Attorney General  as  chairman,  the Commissioner  of  Public Welfare  and  one member  appointed  by  the Governor,  as  the personnel of the council. It would be their duty to periodically examine the prisoners, determine those who were eligible for parole and report their recommendations to the Governor for his guidance. REFORESTRY OF WASTE LANDS. Reforestation has  an  importance  far  above  the  attention  it usually  secures. Particularly  important  both  from the  standpoints of  thrift and economy, and of enhancing  the natural beauties of our State,  is  the  reforestation of our  waste  lands.  If  we  are  to  continue  the  industries  which  are  dependent  upon  the  supply  of  wood  as  raw material we must further our work in forestry development. I am in favor of increasing the forest holdings of the State  and  of  offering  every  encouragement  to  all  who,  realizing  the  benefits  of  conservation  and  development for future generations, seriously undertake the re-making of our forests. PUBLICITY. One of the noteworthy developments of recent years is the remarkable increase in the vacation business and no  state  has  greater  natural  advantages  than  Vermont  for  supplying  the  growing  demand  for  recreation.  This business  has  assumed  large  proportions  in  several  of  the  neighboring  States  and  in  Vermont  there  has  been  a steady  growth  in  this  important  industry.  The  State  Publicity  Bureau  operating  with  a  small  appropriation  for the  past  fifteen  years,  has  done  good work,  and  I  have  been  gratified  to  note  of  late  the  cooperation  of  various State  organizations  with  the  State  Publicity  Department.  Some  persons  who  have  come  into  the  State  for  the summer  have  become  permanent  residents.  Visitors  have  made  investments  in  Vermont  industries  and  in several Vermont  towns  the  presence  of  summer  colonies  has  increased  largely  the  value  of  real  estate  and  has added materially to the revenue secured from taxation. In  view  of  the  growing  importance  of  the  vacation  business,  the  increasing  activity  of  neighboring  States along  this  line,  and  the  need  that Vermont  take  advantage  of  its  opportunities  for  development,  I  believe  that  a larger appropriation for publicity will be a good investment for the State. If  Vermont  is  to  keep  abreast  of  our  national  growth  it  must  be  able  to  adapt  itself  to  changing  conditions and  take  advantage  of  new  opportunities  as  they  present  themselves.  If  we  can  supplement  the  fertility  of  our valleys  by  reaping  harvests  from  the  beauty  of  our  hills  and mountains, we  shall  increase  our  productive  area, and thus enlarge the opportunity afforded our citizens and increase the usefulness of our State. FISH AND GAME. Closely  linked  with  the  development  of  Vermont  as  a  vacation  land  are  the  fish  and  game  interests  of  the State. This feature has grown  into an  important department, which deserves recognition, and commendation for its accomplishments. Because of the importance of the Fish and Game Department to our own people, as well as to the increasing numbers  of  visitors  within  our  borders,  the  policies  of  this  branch  of  our  government  should  be  continued progressively, and every encouragement offered for furthering the work. BENNINGTON SESQUI-CENTENNIAL. Vermont  is  rich  in history. Notable anniversaries of historical events occur  this year,  the year of  the  sesqui-centennial. Particularly noteworthy is the Bennington celebration . I would urge all the citizens of Vermont to a full  support  of  the  anniversary,  as  proper  and  fitting  celebrations  of  such  events  afford  us  opportunities  to reconsecrate ourselves to the great fundamental ideals upon which our Commonwealth was founded. PROPOSED BRIDGE ACROSS LAKE CHAMPLAIN. The  proposed  bridge  across  Lake  Champlain,  connecting  the  states  of New York  and Vermont would  be  a big asset to our State and of material value and importance to our people. The subject has been given intelligent study  by  a  joint  commission.  This  commission  will,  in  due  time,  make  their  report,  based  on  a  scientific investigation  of  engineering  and  traffic  conditions.  I would urge  that  the  subject be given  careful  consideration upon the presentation of the report. Our object should be  the enactment of a few  laws which can be effectively enforced, rather  than many  laws which  are  incapable  of  enforcement.  We  should  at  all  times  stand  unequivocally  for  law  and  order, demonstrating by our attitudes that we have respect for the dignity of our laws. Any  reforms  in our court  system, whereby  technicalities might be eliminated and  justice made more  simple and  speedy,  would,  of  course,  be  an  accomplishment  worth  while.  Likewise  any  tax  reforms  are  advisable,  if they  are  consistent  with  existing  conditions  and  are  founded  on  the  basis  of  equitable  distribution  of  the burdens.  I  do  not  believe  that  the  present  so-called  tax  law  on  intangibles  should  be  hastily  condemned  or summarily  discarded  before  being  given  a  fair  and  thorough  trial.  The  law  has  been  in  effect  only  one  year.  It should be continued until its operation has been more completely demonstrated. This  message,  my  fellow  citizens,  aims  to  be  representative  rather  than  exhaustive.  I  have  confined  the substance  as  carefully  as  possible  to matters  that  immediately  confront  us  on  the  convening  of  the Legislature, and have made no attempt  to cover  the whole field of State Policy. From  time  to  time, according  to our organic law,  I  shall bring before you  such other matters as may  require consideration. The accomplishments of  the past show hope of our ability to meet the problems of the present. Our State, our towns, our cities, are reflected in us. The positions we take on present day problems will be the controlling factors in our government. We are  solicitous  for  the welfare of  the  farmer,  the day  laborer,  the capitalist,  the business and professional man and woman, in the development of old as well as new enterprises. Our water powers, our natural resources, our  scenic  beauties,  and,  above  all,  our  boys  and  girls,  offer  us  opportunities  for  earnest  endeavor  and constructive  development,  which  must  be  undertaken  with  the  idea  of  the  constant  advancement  of  our Commonwealth. The allegiance of our citizenship  is not wholly human. It  is of divine origin, and we cherish an ambition for a contented people whose lives shall merit the favor of Almighty God.  JOHN E. WEEKS
