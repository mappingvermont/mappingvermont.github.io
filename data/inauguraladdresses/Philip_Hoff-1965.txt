Inaugural address of  Philip H. Hoff  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1965       Thursday, January 7, 1965. Inaugural Address Lieutenant-Governor  Daly,  Mr.  Speaker,  President  Pro  Tem,  Members  of  the  Clergy,  Members  of  the General Assembly and my fellow Vermonters: We are assembled today at the direction of the people of Vermont to chart a new course in the history of our great State. I  am  convinced  that  Vermont  is  already  feeling  the  stirrings  of  change  that  promise  the  greatest  era  of progress and development in our history. The forces at work in our world have created almost unparalleled opportunities for Vermont and it is our responsibility to meet this challenge. We must act to control these changes and not be content merely to acknowledge them as inevitable. Today,  more  than  ever  before,  we  must  look  outward  to  understand  the  changes  that  are  taking  place within our own society. Ours  is  a  world  of  many  quiet  revolutions  going  on  simultaneously.  Some  are  easily  noted.  Others, perhaps more difficult to define, give promise of equally dramatic impact upon our lives. The  revolution  in  communications  and  transportation  has  opened  Vermont  to  the  world  in  a  way  not imagined  possible  a  generation  ago.  It  demands  we  educate  our  children  for  living  and  working  in  one world. Population expansion and attendant problems of urbanization make the open space and untouched beauty of  Vermont  the  envy  of  countless  thousands.  It  would  be  naive  to  think  that  this  population  explosion  will not  have  a  tremendous  impact  upon  our  State.  We  must  prepare  now  to  preserve  the  untouched  quality  of Vermont from unplanned and uncontrolled urban growth. The  revolution  in  technology  with  its  promise  of  a  substantially  reduced  work  week  opens  a  new  era where  the effective utilization of  free  time will  figure more and more  in economic development and growth of our State. The revolution in knowledge makes education crucial in our planning for the future. These are but a sampling of the forces at work in our world today that require us to broaden our scope as citizens not only of Vermont but as citizens of a global community. We are indeed fortunate that we face this challenge as citizens of Vermont. For Vermonters have a firm tradition of dedication to democracy. The strength of our democracy has been  that  it was not conceived  to be, nor can we permit  it  to become merely a set of rules to control public organization and debate. Democracy is not neutral. It  is  not  indifferent  to  the  outcome  of man’s  efforts  to  live meaningfully.  It  is  firmly  anchored  on  hope and faith in man’s capacity to build the good life within a free society. It  is  an  open  system  of  values which  embraces  change  and which weaves  new  events  into  the  fabric  of our life as free men. With  this  concept  of  democracy  in  mind,  let  us  now  consider  specific  proposals  designed  to  meet  the problems and to grasp the opportunities presented by the forces at work in our society. We  have  the  resources  to  make  Vermont  a  showcase  for  democracy.  I  suggest  to  you  that  the  people have the will to make our State a laboratory for progress. Let  us  declare  our  determination  that  Vermont  has  not  faltered  and  will  not  be  dissuaded  from  a  bold program  of  action  not  only  to  secure  the  right  of  every  citizen  to  full  and  equal  representation,  but  also  to assure the right of every Vermonter to a productive life pursued in freedom and dignity.   REAPPORTIONMENT Our  first  obligation  is  to  meet  the  challenge  of  the  14th  Amendment  to  provide  equal  protection  to  all citizens before the law. The Courts have  told us what we all have  suspected  for many years. That  is, of course,  that our General Assembly is malapportioned and that we must reapportion it on the basis of one man, one vote. This then is the Assembly’s first and most urgent task. I  urge  you  all  to  consider  this  simple  fact  ...  If  this  Legislature  fails  to  re-organize  itself  to  extend  the franchise so that it is equally shared by every citizen of Vermont, it will be done by the courts. I  am  confident  that  our  record  as  independent  and  fair-minded  citizens  will  not  be  stained  by  failure  to accomplish this task. Thus,  our  first  responsibility  here  is  to  properly  shape  our  Legislature,  our  basic  instrument  for enactment  of  public  policy,  to  better  meet  the  demands  of  our  Democratic  heritage  and  the  needs  of contemporary society. The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  decreed  it  to  be  the  law  of  the  land  that  legislative  bodies  of  the several States must provide for representation based on population. This principle cannot and it will not be compromised. Nothing  will  better  serve  notice  to  the  world  that  Vermonters  are  again  at  the  forefront  in  the  fight  for basic human rights than prompt action on this issue. Nothing will better symbolize our determination to translate the dreams of our forebears into reality. We do not seek to defy tradition. We  seek  only  to  breathe  new  vitality  into  aspirations  that  for  too  long  have  gathered  dust  in  the  public archives. If  there  is  a  single  thread  that  links  the  world  of  today  with  the  aspirations  of  those  who  charted Vermont’s course as a State, it is the idea that government exists to serve the needs of the people when these needs cannot be better met by citizens acting in private concert. Similarly, it is that government is viable and subject to modification as the needs of citizens change. Let me  quote  from  a man whose  hands  held  the pulse of our State  at  its birth.  ... Ethan Allen  said  in  an address to the people of Vermont:  All  good  and  wise  men,  will  exert  themselves  in  establishing  and  supporting  good government  and  order, which  are  inseparably  connected  together. Formed  constitutions  and modes  of  government  may  and  undoubtedly  are,  more  or  less  imperfect;  Yet  they  may,  in future,  be  corrected  and  amended  as  time  of  leisure,  cool  deliberation,  and  experience may dictate.” Ethan Allen, of course, was not alone in his conviction that government is not simply the instrumentality of majority will,  but  the  government’s  role  is  to  transcribe  public  necessity  into  action  to  serve  the  greatest good for the greatest number of people. To accomplish this, government must be directly related to people, not some of the people, but all of the people. Equal  representation  in  government  does  not  pit  town  against  town.  Neither  does  it  pit  urban  residents against rural residents, or those over twenty-one against those who have yet to reach their majority. Bearing  this  in mind  and  the many weeks  of  thoughtful  study  and  planning  that  have  already  gone  into solution of this problem, I am certain this task can and will be met with speed and with justice. Differences  of  opinion  still  exist  on  this  issue  but  I  am  confident  that Vermonters  as men  of  reason  and good will are determined not to fail in this task. Rather  than  to delay or defy what we know must  come  to pass,  I urge  the members of  this Assembly  to   face  the  task  of  reapportionment  immediately  and  with  determination  to  get  the  job  done  so  that  we  can move forward in other areas where action, as we all know, is so urgently needed. In doing  this I would certainly not oppose speedy submission of a reapportionment plan, or even several plans, to the Courts for review. CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION There has been public discussion about possible referral of this question to a Constitutional Convention. Once  we  have  met  the  order  to  reapportion,  it  would  be  to  Vermont’s  overall  advantage  for  the  new Legislature  to  convene  a  convention  to  bring  our Constitution  in  line with  the  realities  of  a Court-approved system of representation. Such a convention would then write into our basic frame of government other long-needed reforms. These would certainly include provision for:  Annual legislative sessions subject to a cut-off period. A four year term for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and other elected State officials. Clarification  and  reform  of  the  elective  process  to  eliminate  the  confusion  surrounding  past elections which involved the necessity for legislative recounts. Liberalizing the provisions for amending the Constitution and elimination of the ten-year time lock. A  strengthening  of  the  executive  arm  through  changes  in  the  mode  of  naming  such  administrative officers as the State Treasurer and Secretary of State. Constitutional  embodiment  of  a  plan  for  continuing  apportionment  of  the  Assembly  in  accordance with changing population patterns. Constitutional provision for a House of Representatives greatly reduced in size. Elimination of our outmoded system of State’s Attorneys. Prompt  compliance with  the mandate  to  reapportion  now  and  provision  for  these  other  basic  reforms  in our  structure  of  government  through  a  convention  would  fulfill  both  responsibilities  with  a  minimum  of confusion and with no threat to the orderly continuation of the State’s business. STATUS OF COURT ACTION The  Supreme  Court  has  stayed  the  lower  Court’s  decree  that  we  act  on  reapportionment  and reapportionment alone. But this cannot be taken as an indication that we will be permitted to procrastinate or that we may ignore our  responsibilities  to  reapportion.  At  best  the  Supreme  Court  will  merely  extend  the  time  in  which  to reapportion  and  allow  the General Assembly  to  act  on  business  other  than  reapportionment.  It must  also  be borne in mind that the Supreme Court might well affirm the lower Court’s original order. THE TASK AHEAD We  are  fortunate  at  the  moment  that  we  can  pursue  the  task  of  reapportionment  while  also  acting  to move Vermont ahead in other areas. Two  years  ago  I  urged  that  we  re-evaluate  and  reform  our  program  of  public  services  in  light  of  the dramatic changes underway  in our society and  the people of Vermont have served notice that they want this done. Vermonters realize  that we cannot divorce ourselves from  the world,  that the events  in far-off corners of the globe directly affect our daily lives. This  fact  is one we cannot afford  to state and  then  ignore. This  fact must be  reflected  in our approach  to education,  to  the  conservation of our natural  resources,  to  economic development  and  the very organization of our system of state and local government. Vermont has  a  strong  tradition  of  town government. Our  town boundaries were drawn  in  colonial  times   roughly  along  lines  six  miles  square.  This  was  done  arbitrarily  and  with  the  exception  of  major  rivers, natural boundaries were frequently ignored. In  the  days  of  communication  no  more  rapid  than  a  horse  and  rider,  our  towns  served  as  efficient  and effective units for the control and operation of education, welfare, highways and other public programs. But over  the years  these arbitrary  town  lines have  increasingly become barriers  to efficient and effective public programs. This  has  been  recognized  and  some  action  has  been  taken  to  cross  town  lines  in  the  administration  of certain public services. Our  administrative units have  frequently been extended  and  expanded  largely, however, on  a haphazard basis and without regard to the overall needs of the people of the State. Progress in one area of the State has not always been matched in other areas. A REGIONAL APPROACH We  now  have  the  information  available  to  organize  many  of  these  services  on  a  regional  basis  so  that they  can  be  more  effectively  administered  for  all  the  people  of  Vermont.  To  this  end,  I  am  calling  for  a regional  approach  to  education,  tax  assessing,  planning,  development,  probate  courts,  municipal  courts, state’s attorneys, and ultimately to our town and State aid system of roads, although here action may have to be deferred until 1966. This is the key to our present program of reorganization and revitalization of our governmental services. We aim to organize these services in districts that include the human and economic resources required to support  them.  This  is  the  only  feasible  way  for  us  to  assure  equality  of  educational  and  economic opportunity to all Vermonters regardless of the town in which they reside. With  imagination  and  the  determination  to  creatively  utilize  our  traditions  and  resources we  can  set  the pace for progress in combating educational deficiencies, poverty, and other problems. Vermont  has  the  talent  and  the  resources  to  achieve  this  goal.  We  also  are  small  enough  so  that  the magnitude of the problem can be clearly seen and our progress can be easily demonstrated. EDUCATION Our greatest resource and our greatest responsibility is the talent of our people. Two  years  ago  I  described  education  as  the  keystone  to  our  future  development. This  is  even more  true today. We  have made  great  progress  in  the past  two  years. State-aid  has  been  increased  and  is  now  distributed on an equalized basis. Much  remains  to  be  done,  however,  before we  can  say  to  ourselves we  are meeting  the  needs  of  today, much less the needs of tomorrow. For  this  reason  I  recommend  an  additional  1.5  million  dollars  in  State-aid  to  local  school  districts  in 1966  and  2.5  million  in  1967,  or  a  total  of  4  million  for  the  biennium.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  additional million in 1967 will be keyed to quality and/or regionalization. This will provide for total State-aid of approximately $9,000,000 in 1966 and $10,000,000 in 1967. Besides  these  increases  in  State-aid  to  education  under  the  formula,  my  budget  will  provide  for  1.8 million in new aid for construction and operation of area vocational centers. Fifty percent of this money will be Federal grants. In  considering  State-aid  to  education  we  must  also  note  that  Vermont  will  be  required  to  supply approximately  1  million  of  State  funds  to  continue  the  present  federally  financed  manpower  retraining program. Of  equal  importance  in  our  endeavor  to  better  educate  our  young  people  is  the  reorganization  of  our school districts so that they more adequately include the resources required for their support.   I  will  submit  to  you  a  plan  for  regionalized  districts  that  will  accomplish  this  on  a  voluntary  basis  but which will not permit our residents to disregard the need for rapid progress in this area. This  task  requires  additional money  to  strengthen  the Department  of Education,  to  finance more  classes for the mentally retarded and the handicapped, for retraining and for vocational education as I will outline in my budget message. Ever  increasing costs  for  top quality educational programs at  the  level beyond  the high school must also be recognized. We  embarked  upon  a  pilot  program  of  State-guaranteed  loans  for  college  freshmen  earlier  this  year. Despite  predictions  that  there  was  no  need  for  this,  the  program  has  already  helped  many,  many  young Vermonters finance their college education. This  aid  must  be  expanded  and  I  will  recommend  that  it  be  consolidated  with  a  program  of  State scholarships  administered  on  the  basis  of merit  by  an  independent Board  rather  than  through  our  individual Senators as is presently done. Additional funds will be required also to strengthen the quality of educational programs at the University of Vermont and our State colleges. Authority  will  be  sought  to  assist  private  colleges  and  secondary  schools  through  State  guarantee  of loans for plant and capital improvements as is now authorized for industrial projects. You will be asked  to  inaugurate an educational  television network and  to  increase minimum salaries  for Vermont public school teachers. COURTS The  concept  of  better  organizing  our  resources  in  support  of  public  enterprise  and  private  well-being applies to the administration of justice. A district or regional organization of our Courts has had widespread support for many years. Certainly, this basic reform of our Courts is long overdue. In this age we need a system of District Courts presided  over  by  full-time  adequately  paid  judges  and  this  should  apply  equally  to  our  present  Probate Courts as well as to our Municipal Courts. Linked  to  this  should  be  a  network  of  full-time  adequately  paid  district  attorneys  supervised  by  a strengthened Attorney General’s office. No  reform of our Court  system will be complete without modification of our  system  for  the  selection of superior judges. I strongly endorse a method patterned after the Missouri Plan. PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT The  concept  of  district  reorganization  is  also  essential  for  us  to  follow  if  we  are  to  promote  greater effectiveness at the least cost in the field of planning and development. We must structure our public services to more effectively reflect our changing population patterns. Here  again,  I  propose  a  new  program  of  State  assistance  to  local  industrial  development  groups  to stimulate  regional  planning  and  zoning.  This  will  involve  additional  State  personnel  and  grants  to  regional organizations  that  meet  realistic  standards.  We  must  promote  increased  programs  of  research  and development  to  assist  the  residents  of  every  area  in  the  State  in  reaching  their  maximum  potential.  This applies  equally  if  our  agricultural  growth  is  to  be  more  than  a  series  of  crisis  situations.  A  pilot  project  is nearly operational and should provide effective guide lines for progress in long range assistance to farmers. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR This  means  adequate  paying  jobs  and  a  Department  of  Labor  to  oversee  the  operation  of  day-to-day industrial  relations.  This  also  requires  a  minimum  wage  tied  directly  to  the  national  level.  I  recommend consolidation  of  the Department  of Employment  Security  and  the Department  of  Industrial Relations  into  a new Department of Labor. With this should be passed a Little Wagner Act. The  extension  of  coverage  of  unemployment  benefits  as  well  as  a  strengthened  program  of  workman’s   compensation are directly related to this development program. So  too  is  continued  provision  for  the  manpower  retraining  program  and  increased  emphasis  on vocational training. NATURAL RESOURCES Of  equal  importance  to  total  development  of  our  State  is  the  conservation  of  our  natural  resources  and the protection of our heritage of scenic beauty from the blight of uncontrolled urban sprawl. This  will  require  increased  State-aid  for  local  pollution  abatement  programs.  It  will  require  broadening the State’s land condemnation authority for certain public purposes. It  will  require  minimum  flow  legislation  and  a  long  range  program  to  assure  every  Vermonter  an adequate water supply. The  cleaning  up  of  our  streams,  the  protection  of  our  wealth  of  water  resources  should  also  include expansion  of  coordinated  recreational  facilities.  In  this  regard,  I  will  recommend  increased  bonding  to finance State participation in developing Federal and State outdoor recreation programs. I  anticipate  great  progress  in  this  area  within  the  next  few  years.  Vermont  and  the  nation  are  deeply committed  to  the  planned  public  development  of  our  forests,  our  parks  and  our  unique  natural  geographic areas. This will  increasingly  involve State-Federal cooperation  in multi-purpose development of our  resources. It will also require that we move forward promptly to meet our need for regional zoning. A  land  use  survey  is  underway.  It  is  an  essential  step  in  a  regional  zoning  plan  I  propose  to  present  in 1966. HEALTH, WELFARE, SAFETY In  the same manner we cannot separate highway safety and  the expansion of our State police force from other programs designed  to protect human  resources. We cannot  treat agriculture apart  from  the  food  stamp program we will recommend. These are merely facets of a single, far-reaching effort to move our State forward so that our people may enjoy a fuller, safer and healthier life. I will recommend an expansion  in our welfare department, an expanded program of highway safety, and expansion of our State Police to include forty-two new troopers during the biennium. Vermonters  as  consumers must  have more  protection  through  expanded  public  health  programs. Driver training programs merit State  support as do projects designed  to  seek out and  retrain persons who make our highways unsafe. Specifics  of  these  programs  will  be  spelled  out  in  future  messages,  as  will  my  recommendations  for highways and State finances. GOVERNMENT OPERATION The competition for progress in an ever-shrinking world has intensified the need for top quality men and women to serve State government. This competition for talent demands that we more adequately compensate those  who  serve.  It  also  demands  that  we  reorganize  our  government  to  assure  a  full  dollar’s  return  for  a dollar spent. I  recommend  a  major  revision  in  our  pay  scale,  and  consolidation  of  more  of  the  executive  branch  of government  as  called  for  by  the  Little  Hoover  Commission.  Similarly  I  will  recommend  creation  of  a Legislative Council to strengthen the operations of the General Assembly, and this is long overdue. In this area, as in so many others, we have moved forward. But the steps outlined above should be taken if we are indeed to become the showcase for democracy or the laboratory for progress that I know that we all desire. It is within our grasp. It merits our full attention and best effort.   STEWARDS OF HOPE Ours is a time not of triumph but of dedication. We meet here not as exponents of party but as stewards of hope. We share a sacred trust, the future of our great State. Let  us  draw  that  future  in  bold  strokes with  confidence  in  our mission  and  faith  that men  of  reason  and good will can chart a course of action that will serve humanity. Working  together  I  am  confident  that  with  divine  guidance,  we  can  and  we  will  meet  the  test  of  our times. . . . That no man, however humble his origin, however remote his domicile be denied the opportunity to fully exploit and enjoy his status as a member of our free society. Thank you very much.
