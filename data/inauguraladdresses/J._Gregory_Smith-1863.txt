Inaugural address of  John Gregory Smith  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  Annual Session  1863          Friday, October 9, 1863 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: As we  assemble once  again  for  the  exercise of  the high and  responsible duties assigned by  the Constitution of  the  State,  let  us  devoutly  render  to  Almighty  God  our  homage  of  praise  and  thanksgiving,  that  He  has vouchsafed to us His blessing for the past year; that he has graciously permitted us, as a nation, to rejoice in His returning favor, and has crowned our arms with many and signal successes.  In  the  discharge  of  the  high  trust  committed  to  your  care,  many  subjects  will  be  brought  before  you  for consideration,  deeply  affecting  the  welfare  of  the  State,  and  the  material  condition  of  those  whose representatives  and  servants  you  are;  and  in  briefly  directing  your  attention  to  some  of  these,  I  respectfully invite for them your careful deliberation, and your most dispassionate counsels.  FINANCES OF THE STATE I  herewith  transmit  a  report  of  the  Treasurer  of  the  State,  exhibiting  the  transactions  of  that  department  for the past fiscal year. From this report it appears that the total receipts into the Treasury from all sources have been  Total disbursements,   $2,852,451 99   2,730,018 24 -------------------   $122,433 75   1,130,723 62  453,478 31    $122,433 75 54,370 69 ----------------- 176,804 44 --------------------   $276,673 89  Leaving balance on hand, Sept. 5, 1863,  The amount of funded liabilities is stated to be  The amount of current liabilities,   Balance in Treasury,  Due on Taxes,              Excess of liabilities over resources,  To which are to be added the expenses for the current year, approximately estimated as follows:  Extra pay of $7 per month of to the soldiers now in service,  Ordinary State Expenses,  Interest on loans and funded debt,     Balance of bonds authorized in 1862, but not yet issued,   Leaving to be provided for,  To which should be added whatever expenses may be incurred in raising additional troops.

I commit the question to your consideration, believing that you will, even better than myself, understand the feelings  and  wishes  of  your  several  constituencies,  and  that  you  will  bring  to  the  subject  that  enlightened  and careful judgment which its magnitude and importance demands. MILITARY By  the report of  the Adjutant and Inspector General,  it appears  that Vermont has sent  into  the service of  the United  States  sixteen  regiments  of  infantry,  one  regiment  of  light  artillery,  numbering  in  all  18,224  men.  Of these,  the  first  regiment  of  infantry,  the  three  month’s men,  were  returned  and  discharged  at  the  expiration  of their  term  of  enlistment,  leaving  at  the  commencement  of  the  present  year,  fifteen  regiments  infantry,  one regiment  cavalry,  three  companies  sharpshooters,  and  two  batteries  of  artillery.  No  additional  regiments  have been  raised  during  the  year.  During  the  present  season,  the  12th,  13th,  14th,  15th  and  16th  regiments  of  nine month’s  men  have  been  mustered  out  of  service,  their  time  of  enlistment  having  expired.  The  year  from  the various casualties of war, the whole number now remaining being only 7884, of whom only 6150 are on duty. It  is,  therefore,  a  duty  which  the  State  owes  to  the  Government  that  these  regiments  should  be  filled  as speedily  as  possible. Every  consideration  of  patriotism,  justice  to  the  noble men who  have  born  the  burdens  of the  fight  hitherto,  and  whose  ranks  have  been  thinned  by  the  heroic  and  fearless  exposures  to  the  fire  of  the enemy,  the honor of  the State, all, conspire  to heighten  the obligation which  the State  is under,  to urge new and fresh recruits into the ranks as rapidly as possible. It  was  at  one  time  in  contemplation  by  the  Government  to  consolidate  the  decimated  regiments  as  far  as could  be  done,  as  a  measure  of  relief,  and  as  the  surest  means  at  hand,  of  securing  the  most  effective  service, with the limited number of troops then at the command of the Government. Such a measure, however necessary and justifiable it may have at the moment seemed, would have been most unjust to the war-worn and noble men and  officers,  who  had  so  bravely  and  faithfully  done  their  duty.  It  was  not  their  fault  that  their  ranks  were thinned; it bespoke the highest commendation for their fortitude and courage, and hence, it was but just to those veteran regiments, that their organizations should be preserved, and they be permitted, if possible, to fight under the  same  associations,  and  side  by  side  with  tried  and  familiar  comrades,  rather  than  be  consolidated  with stranger  troops,  and  under  untried  commanders.  Fully  appreciating  the  justice  of  this  measure,  and  the advantages to be derived from it, in May last, my predecessor called the attention of the Secretary of War to the importance of filling the ranks of the veteran regiments with new recruits, rather than consolidate the regiments in  the  field, and augment  the army by new  regiments  for service. The Secretary of War adopted  the suggestion, and decided  to appropriate  the avails of  the  then approaching draft  to  the recruiting of  the old  regiments.  It was hoped  that  sufficient men would  thus  be  realized  to meet  the  demand.  The  result  of  the  draft,  however,  shows that only one-fourth of the requisite of men has been furnished. Opportunity has more recently been offered by the Government, through the agency of recruiting officers, to enlist men  to  fill  these  regiments,  offering  as  inducement  large  bounties,  both  to  veterans  and  now  recruits,  to enlist.  It  becomes,  therefore,  more  imperatively  the  duty  of  the  State,  and  of  every  patriotic  citizen  to  aid  this effort by every means in their power.  THE DRAFT Under  the Act of Congress, approved March 3d, 1863, providing “for enrolling and calling out  the National forces  and  for other purposes,”  the militia of  this State were duly  enrolled  in  June  last,  and  a draft was ordered to be made under  the direction of officers  appointed by  the United States Government. The  constitutional  right of  the  Government  to  adopt  this  method  of  raising  troops,  has  been  called  in  question,  and  serious embarrassments  have  arisen,  in  consequence  of  organized  efforts  in  various  parts  of  the  country  to  resist  the draft. Studious efforts have been made to throw odium upon this measure, by characterizing it as a conscription, and  by  this  means  to  deter  citizens  from  yielding  that  cheerful  compliance  to  the  demands  of  the  law,  which, more than ever, in this terrible crisis, it was their duty to do. The law, so far from being a conscription, in any sense charged against it, is relieved entirely of all that was odious  under  the  old  French  system,  and  only  provides,  in  the  mildest  form  known  to  history,  the  simple  and most equitable form of a draft, with  the addition of a reasonable and mild commutation, so moderate  in amount as to place it within the power of men of limited means even, to avail themselves of the provision. There can be no  doubt,  under  any  fair  and  reasonable  interpretation  of  the  Constitution,  but  that Congress  had  the  clear  and obvious  power  to  resort  to  this mode  of  raising men  to  replenish  the wasted  army.  Independently,  however,  of all  questions  of  Constitutional  authority,  it  is  the  law  of  the  land,  and  as  such,  is  entitled  to  the  obedience  and respect of  the  citizens of  the Government,  until  in  the  proper  and  legitimate method,  it  is  judicially  determined to be unconstitutional, and therefore void. The quota assessed to this State, to be raised under the act, was 4715. Of this number only 948 have entered the  service  or  furnished  substitutes,  and  1833  have  paid  the  commutation.  There  has  thus  been  paid,  by  the citizens of this State, into the Treasury of the United States, about Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars. The  men  raised  by  the  draft  have  been  sent  to  the  2nd,  3rd  and  4th  regiments,  excepting  164,  performing duty at Brattleboro. STATE MILITIA AND MILITIA LAW The  Legislature  at  its  last  session  passed  an  act  for  “the  organization,  regulation  and  government  of  the Militia of this State.” The act provides  simply  for an enrollment of persons  liable  to do military duty, between  the ages of 18 and 45,  and  for  the  proper  exemptions.  In  case  of  “war,  invasion,  the  prevention  of  invasion,  the  suppression  of insurrection or  riots, and  to aid civil officers  in  the execution of  the  laws of  the State,  the Commander-in-Chief may order for actual service, by draft or otherwise, as many of the enrolled Militia, as the case demands.” In the event the militia are called out, upon the happening of any of the contingencies named in the act, then provision is made for the proper drafting, the system of substituting, the mode of organization, and such other measures as are necessary to render the military power of the State, efficient and serviceable. For  all  immediate  practical  purposes,  therefore,  beyond  a  simple  enrollment,  the  law  is  wholly  without value, and really affords to the State no protection, nor present available means of defense. In  pursuance  of  the  act,  the  proper  instructions,  forms,  blanks,  &c.,  were  prepared  and  distributed  to  the selectmen  of  the  several  towns,  and  the  militia  of  the  State  were  duly  enrolled  in  the  month  of  January  last. Medical  Boards  were  appointed,  furnished  with  the  necessary  instructions,  and  held  sessions  in  the  different counties,  for  the  purpose  of  examining  and  exempting  such  as  were  not  liable  to  do  military  duty. Commissioners were also appointed to enroll the militia in the Gores and unorganized towns in the State. The result of the enrollment was as follows:   Number enrolled,  3, 384  Exempted by Medical Boards,  13,687 —17,071    In United States Service,   ---------  Total number liable to draft,  30,112  Of  this  number  there  are  known  to  be  many  who  are  wholly  unfit  for  military  service,  being  notoriously disabled,  and who  from  that  fact  refused  or  neglected  to  attend  before  the Medical Board  for  examination,  and pay  the  fee prescribed by  the act, because  they  felt certain of being exempted,  if drafted. As a  result of  this,  the quota  of  the  State  is  largely  increased,  and  additional  burdens  are  imposed  upon  those  liable  to  draft,  and injustice is thereby done to the State. I would call your especial attention  to  this subject, and would  recommend  that  the  law be modified  so as  to guard against such a result in the future. The best mode of remedying the evil is left to your judgment. Whether it would be better  to abolish altogether  the  fee  required  to be paid  to  the Board by  the applicant  for  exemption, or whether  it would be  sufficient  to authorize  the board  to  refund,  to every person who  receives a  certificate of exemption,  the  fee  advanced  by  him,  are  questions  for  your  consideration.  Additional  provision  could  also  be 47,183 made  for  ascertaining  and  enrolling  with  more  care  the  men  who  are  in  the  service  of  the  United  States,  and their exemption for that cause should be properly shown upon the enrollment list. In the present disturbed state of affairs, both as regards the civil strife which is raging in our country, as also the  critical  position  of  the  relations  of  this  country  with  foreign  nations,  it  becomes  a  question  of  serious moment  for you, gentlemen,  to consider whether a more efficient and active militia  system  is not now  required in  the State. The  active preparations which  are being made  in  a neighboring  province  for  a  complete,  thorough and  efficient organization of  their militia,  should properly  lead us  to  inquire  into  the  state of our own defenses, and  the  condition  in which we  as  a  State would  be  left,  in  the  event  of  a  disturbance  of  the  amicable  relations, for the present subsisting, between this Government and foreign powers. I invite your thoughtful attention to the subject,  confident  that  you  will  bestow  upon  it  that  deliberate  consideration  which  its  importance  justly demands. THE SICK AND WOUNDED SOLDIERS IN HOSPITAL. The communication  from my predecessor, already  laid before you, gives  the  full particulars on  this subject. It appears that over twenty-five hundred sick and wounded Vermont soldiers, in more than one hundred general hospitals, in the different states, have been visited, and over one thousand have been transferred to the hospitals in  the  different  States,  have  been  visited,  and  over  one  thousand  have  been  transferred  to  the  hospitals  in Vermont. The change of air and treatment thus secured, has not only been of immense value to the poor soldier, but has contributed a larger percent of cured and returned to duty, than from any other general hospitals known. The system is of great value, and no effort of mine shall be wanting to give it all the efficiency the nature of the case will admit of.  THE STATE IN HER AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS AND PROSPECTS. I  have  only  time  to  allude,  in  a  general way,  to  the material  interests of Vermont,  in  that department of her industry which constitutes alike her pride, and her chief  source of wealth.  In  an  eminent degree, Vermont  is  an agricultural  State,  and  it  is  to  this,  more  perhaps,  than  to  any  other  source,  that  she  is  indebted  for  the  high character  for  virtue  and  morality,  which  she  everywhere  sustains  –  for  that  spirit  of  exalted  patriotism,  which has  ever  been  her  leading  characteristic,  and  for  that  love  of  freedom  and  free  institutions which  have  secured for her and enviable distinction on the records of our nation’s history. Within the last decade of the agricultural interests of Vermont have received an impetus and a growth which has  placed  her  in  the  foremost  ranks.  The  ready  means  of  transportation  to  market,  afforded  by  her  railroads, placing  her  thus  in  ready  communication  with  the  seaboard,  for  foreign  markets,  and  with  the  large  and prosperous  manufacturing  districts  of  neighboring  States,  have  contributed  in  no  small  degree  to  the advancement and prosperity of the State in this her leading interest. Already  have  her  dairy  products  and  her  horses  found  their  way  to  foreign  markets,  and  acquired  an enviable  notoriety,  and  still  more  recently,  her  sheep  have  been  introduced  into  favorable  notice  in  foreign countries,  and  under  circumstances  likely  to  secure  to Vermont,  not  only  a  high  reputation,  but  to  bring  her  in return, a  rich and extensive  trade  in  that branch of her  industry.  In February  last,  the State Agricultural Society appointed  Hon.  Daniel  Needham,  the  efficient  Secretary  of  the  Society,  Commissioner  to  attend  and  represent the  to  be  held  at  Hamburg,  in  Germany.  Other  States  were  represented  at  the  Exhibition  by  Commissioners appointed  under  State  authority.  New  York,  Rhode  Island,  Massachusetts,  New  Jersey,  Illinois,  and  I  think Pennsylvania,  were  all  represented.  Among  another  products  taken  from  Vermont  by  the  Commissioner  for exhibition, were  taken  from Vermont by  the Commissioner  for exhibition, were  twelve merino sheep, and  I am happy to congratulate the State upon the success which attended the enterprise. In  the  list  for competitors  for prizes at  the Exhibition, were more  than  two  thousand sheep,  representing  the best  flocks  from  all  the Germanic  states,  from France, England,  and  nearly  all  the  countries of Central Europe. Against  this  strong  competition,  and  contending  against  the  natural  prejudices  existing  towards  American products,  Vermont  won,  at  the  hands  of  an  able  and  impartial  board  of  judges,  the  two  first  prizes,  and  one second  prize,  for  her  sheep.  The  result  of  this  to  the  sheep  breeding  interests  of  Vermont,  can  hardly  be estimated. It was a great achievement, and is destined to give to America, and especially to Vermont, that which Europe has for so long a time almost exclusively enjoyed, to the rich and valuable trade in stockbreeding sheep. AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE – LAND SCRIP. The  Legislature  at  its  last  session  passed  an  act  “providing  for  the  appointment  of  agents  to  receive  and dispose of the land scrip to which this State may be entitled under the act of Congress, approved July 2d, 1862.” The  act,  after  appointing  the  agents  to  receive  the  scrip,  and  conferring  upon  them  certain  powers,  and imposing upon them certain duties, authorizes the Governor of the State to receive proposals for such donations of land, buildings and funds, as my be tendered from any portion of the State, or from any person or persons, for the purpose of establishing a College, according  to  the provisions of  the act of Congress. The act also provides, “that  all moneys  derived  from  the  sale  of  the  land  scrip  shall  be  invested  by  the  Treasurer  of  the  State,  in  safe stocks, yielding not less than five per cent. Upon the par value of the stocks, and the interest of the fund shall be appropriated for the purposes declared in the act of Congress.” The  act  of  Congress  donates  to  each  State  land  to  the  amount  of  thirty  thousand  acres  to  each  Senator  and Representative in Congress, the proceeds of the sale of which, or of the land scrip to be issued therefor, is to be invested in stocks of the United States, or of the States, or some other safe stocks, yielding not less than five per cent,  upon  the  par  value  of  said  stocks,  and  to  constitute  a  perpetual  fund,  the  interest  of  which  is  to  be inviolably appropriated to the endowment, support and maintenance of at least one College in each State, where the  leading  object  shall  be,  without  excluding  other  scientific  and  classical  studies,  and  including  military tactics,  to  teach  such branches of  learning as are  related  to Agriculture, and  the Mechanic Arts,  in such manner as  the  Legislatures  of  the  States  may  respectively  prescribe,  in  order  to  promote  the  liberal  and  practical education  of  the  industrial  classes  in  the  several  pursuits  and  professions  in  life, —  and  further  providing  that any State which may  take  the benefit of  the provisions of  the act,  shall provide, within  five years  from  the date of said act, at least on College, as described in the act, or the grant to the State to cease; and requiring the State, by  its  legislation,  to  express  its  acceptance  of  the  provisions  of  the  act  within  two  years  from  the  date  of  its approval. This brief synopsis of the general features of the act of Congress will enable you to understand more readily the  position  which  this  State,  by  its  action  at  the  last  session  of  the  Legislature,  occupies  in  reference  to  the subject.  The  act  of  last  fall  expressed  the  acceptance,  by  the  State,  of  the  provisions  of  the  act  of  Congress, within  the  prescribed  period.  It  also  appointed  agents  to  procure  the  land  scrip  from  the  United  States Government,  to which  this State  is  entitled,  to dispose of  the  same,  and  invest  the proceeds of  the  sales  in  safe stocks,  bearing  not  less  than  five  per  cent.,  and  appropriated  the  fund  to  establish  a College,  as  required by  the act of Congress.  The agents appointed under the act will, in due time, submit a report of their doings. I understand, however, that  application  has  been  made  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  for  the  land  scrip,  and  that  the  scrip  either  has already been, or will soon be, issued by the State. There  remains  now  but  a  little  more  than  three  years,  within  which  time  the  state  must  comply  with  the provisions  of  the  act  of  Congress,  and  establish  a  College  for  the  purposes  specified,  or  the  grant,  as  to  this State, is to cease. The  shortness  of  the  time,  the  importance  and  magnitude  of  the  enterprise,  its  effects  upon  the  education interests of the State, and the great variety of questions involved, justify me in calling your especial attention to the subject at this time. By  the  terms  of  the  grant,  there  will  fall  to  the  share  of  Vermont  one  hundred  and  fifty  thousand  acres  of land,  which,  at  the  minimum  valuation  of  government  lands,  is  equivalent  to  one  hundred  and  eighty-seven thousand  five  hundred  dollars,  which,  safely  invested  in  our  own  State  stocks,  bearing  six  per  cent.  Interest, would  yield  an  annual  income  of  eleven  thousand  two  hundred  and  fifty  dollars,  for  the  support  of  the institution  to  be  established;  or,  computing  the  valuation  at  double  the  minimum  price,  which  it  is  not unreasonable  to  expect  to  realize  for  the  scrip,  and which  is  the  rate  for  railroad grants,  the valuation  at double the  minimum  price,  which  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  expect  the  realize  for  the  scrip,  and  which  is  the  rate  for railroad  grants,  the  valuation  would  be  equivalent  to  three  hundred  and  seventy  five  thousand  dollars.  These valuations  of  land,  or  amounts  to  be  realized  from  the  sales  of  the  land  scrip,  will  be  varied  according  the circumstances, and may be enhanced or diminished according to the location, and the judgment and skill used in making  sales of  the  same,  and  a variety of other  causes  that may  contribute  to  appreciate  or  lessen  the  demand for  them.  Taking  into  account  the  tide  of  emigration  setting  towards  this  country,  growing  out  of  the  efforts being made, and the various organizations which have been formed, in various parts of the country, to stimulate and encourage it, it is but reasonable to suppose, that with proper care in the location of the lands, and judgment in the sales of the scrip, at least the last figures named above may be realized to the State. The  object  of  this  generous  grant  is  fully  expressed  in  the  act  itself,  “the  endowment,  support  and maintenance  of  at  least  one  College,  where  the  leading  object  shall  be,  without  excluding  other  scientific  and classical  studies,  and  including military  tactics,  to  teach  such  branches  of  learning  as  are  related  to  agriculture and  the  mechanic  arts,  in  such  manner  as  the  legislature  of  the  States  may  respectively  prescribe,  in  order  to promote  the  liberal and practical  education of  the  industrial  classes,  in  the  several pursuits and professions  in life.”  A  most  worthy  object  indeed—and  sustained  by  a  most  munificent  grant,—available  to  every  state  and abundant,  if  properly  managed,  to  secure  the  desired  end—the  education  and  consequent  elevation  of  the masses  of  the  people.  Fully  harmonizing  with  the  genius  of  our  democratic  institutions,  utilitarian  in  its  scope and  plans,  favoring  no  privileged  class,  but  generously  opening  broad  the  door  for  the  liberal  and  practical education  of  the  industrial  classes,  affording  them  access,  not  only  to  the  higher  branches  of  a  scientific  and classical  education,  but  superadding  to  this  a  systematic  and  thorough  training  in  the  every-day,  practical,  and hitherto almost untaught, science of agriculture and the mechanic arts. To Vermont,  this  scheme  has  a  peculiar  values  and  importance.  Eminently  practical  in  all  her  pursuits  and interests,  with  a  population  hardly  equaled,  certainly  not  surpassed,  in  intelligence  and  virtue,  her  hardy  sons only  need  the  stimulating  influences  which  a  thorough  education  in  such  an  institution,  properly  managed, would afford, to place them in the foremost ranks among the cultivated and refined, and secure to her a position for intelligence, wealth, influence and refinement, second to none in the great sisterhood of states. The  grave  question,  however,  arises,  how  the  benefit  to  be  derived  from  such  an  institution  can  best  be secured. Shall  it be established as a separate and  independent  institution,  in which  shall be  taught all  the higher branches  of  a  scientific  and  classical  education,  with  a  school  for  military  tactics,  and  the  agricultural  and mechanical  branches?  This  is,  manifestly,  the  design  and  scope  of  the  grant.  But  can  such  a  College  be sustained,  and  yet  justice  be  done  to  the  other  institutions,  already  established  in  the  State,  and  which,  to  a greater or  less extent, have always been under  its fostering care? Can a department of agriculture and mechanic arts,  and  of  military  tactics,  be  attached  to  one  or  the  other  of  these  institutions,  without  creating  local jealousies, and in this way secure the benefits of the act? There  are  now  in  the  State  two  Colleges  and  one  Military  School,  —  each  of  them  established  under  the authority  of  the  State  Legislature,  with  certain  powers  and  privileges,  and  each  having  been  made  the beneficiaries,  to  greater  or  less  extent,  of  gifts,  bequests  and  endowments,  and  yet,  so  far  as  my  knowledge extends,  neither  of  them  is  fully  self-sustaining,  and  although  they  all  rank  high  as  seminaries  of  learning,  and have  accomplished  a good work  in  the  cause of  education, numbering  among  their  alumni many of  the noblest minds of  the country, of whom  the State and  the  institutions may well be proud, yet,  in  financial  resource,  they have  not  that  healthful  vigor  and  strength  necessary  to  a  full  and  proper  development,  and without which  it  is, and ever must be, impossible to realize the true idea of their creation. If a plan could be devised, by which the several institutions could be combined into one, uniting the strength and  resources  of  all,  and  adding  to  this  the  departments  contemplated  by  the  act  of  Congress,  and  securing thereby  the  funds  to  be  received  from  the  grant  of  lands,  then,  indeed,  might  be  realized  the  true  idea  of  a University  for  the State,  an  institution which would  justly  be  the  pride  of  the State,  an  institution which would justly  be  the  pride  of  the  State,  and  which,  without  being  its  beneficiary,  would  yet  receive  its  liberal countenance  and  its  patronage.  For  such  an  institution,  in  all  its  various  departments,  the  best  talent  of  the country could be secured, and a rank and character given to it that few institutions now enjoy. I am by no means unmindful of the difficulties that lie at the threshold of such an enterprise. There are local questions and  jealousies  to overcome, all  the  feelings which  so  strongly  attach  to Alma Mater,  and  a variety of difficulties,  that  will  naturally  occur  to  the  minds  of  all.  Still,  are  not  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  a combination  of  these  several  institutions,  and  the  establishment  of  one,  on  the  basis  which  I  have  suggested, sufficient  to  override  all  these  objections  and  difficulties?  Will  not  the  new  impulse  be  given  to  the  cause  of education,  and  the  facilities  to  be  afforded  to  the  industrial  classes  in  the  State,  through  the  agency  of  a  well organized  institution of  this kind, be sufficient  inducement  to overcome  local prejudices and feelings, and other minor difficulties that may stand in the way? There is another feature connected with this subject, which may not be unworthy of consideration. By  the  act  of  last  fall,  the  Treasurer  is  authorized  “to  invest  the  proceeds  of  the  sales  of  the  land  scrip  in some  safe  stocks,  yielding  not  less  than  five  per  cent.  Per  annum;”  and  the  act  of  Congress  authorizes  the investment  in United States  stocks, or  in State  stocks. The amount  to be  realized  from  the  sales of  this  scrip, as has  already  been  stated,  will  vary  according  to  circumstances,  but  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  hope  that  it  may reach the highest figures named. The  present  funded  debt  of  the  State,  as  now  authorized  bearing  six  per  cent  per  annum,  is  one million  six hundred and fifty thousand dollars. May not a portion of this debt be permanently merged in this land-scrip fund, and thus the State be benefited to  that  extent,  in  a  permanent  investment,  the  interest of which  shall be paid  to her own  institution,  and  for  the benefit of a cause, so commendable as that of the educational growth and prosperity of her own citizens? Whether  any  action  is  required  at  the  present  session  of  the  Legislature  in  reference  to  this  subject,  is  left entirely  for  you  to  determine.  The  suggestions  which  have  occurred  to  me  I  have  given,  merely  for  your consideration  and  not  as  seeking  to  direct  your  action.  If  the  attempt  to  unite  the  several  institutions  should  be deemed  advisable,  and  it  should  be  found  practicable  to  do  so,  some  legislation  will  doubtless  be  required,  as the charters creating them do not, I think, contemplate any such union. Whether  it  may  be  advisable  or  not  to  pass  an  enabling  act,  at  the  present  session,  to  provide  for  such  an event,  if  the  public  and  the  patrons  and  friends  of  the  institution  should  desire  it,  or  whether  it  may  not  be sufficient to refer the whole subject to a Board of Commissioners, to inquire into and report at a future time, are questions  for  you  to  determine.  It  will  give  me  great  pleasure  to  conform  to,  and  to  aid  any  course  of  action which the Legislature may be pleased to adopt in the premises. THE SOLDIER AND THE STATE. I  would  earnestly  recommend  the  passage  of  a  law  securing  to  the  soldiers  who  are  now  already,  or  who may hereafter be  called  into  the  service of  the United States,  from  this State,  the  right  to  exercise  their  elective franchise,  and guaranteed  and  secured  to  the  freemen of  this State by  its Constitution;  and  I would  respectfully urge  this measure upon your consideration, as an act of  justice  to  the brave  sons and  freemen of Vermont, who are  so  nobly  doing  battle  in  the  cause  of  the  country  and  as  a  fitting  testimonial  of  the  appreciation  in  which those services are held by the people of the State. Moved  by  an  earnest  patriotism,  and  in  the  holy  ardor  of  an  undying  love  for  the  great  blessings  of  civil liberty,  restrained  by  no  mean  circumstance  of  personal  cost  or  sacrifice,  and  with  a  devoted  loyalty  to  that government  which  has  been  their  shield  and  protection,  they  have  gone  forth  from  among  us,  a  noble brotherhood,  to  imperil  life,  and  all  that  life  holds  dear,  to  battle,  not  for  glory  or  renown,  but  to  maintain  for and perpetuate  to us,  in common with all  the country,  the great and glorious principles of constitutional  liberty, the heritage of a free people. Enduring  all  the  hardships  and  privations  of  the  camp,  denying  themselves  the  comforts,  the  luxuries  and privileges  of  home  communions, which we  are  permitted  to  enjoy,  far  away  from  us,  on  a  stranger  and  hostile soil,  worn  and  wasted  by  many  sufferings,  yet  nobly  bearing  up  under  them  all  with  a  patience  and  fortitude worthy  of  the  cause  for  which  they  suffer,  knowing  but  one  duty,  service  to  their  country,  they  appeal  in language  too strong  to be  resisted,  for  that privilege which all  freemen so highly prize, which, whether at home or on the field, is ever dear to their hearts, the right to exercise the elective franchise, that distinguishing mark of freedom  and  freemen.  It  surely  needs  no  words  of  mine  to  urge  this  upon  your  consideration,  and  while  I  am deeply  sensible  of  the  difficulties  that  surround  the  question,  and  of  the  opportunity  which  would  be  afforded for  abuse  of  the  privilege,  yet,  I  am  fully  confident,  that  it  is  in  the  power  of  the  Legislature  to  frame  a  law, which,  while  it  will  secure  the  State  to  all  reasonable  extent  against  frauds  and  abuse,  will  also  secure  to  the citizen  soldiers  a  privilege  which  it  is  ungenerous  to  deny,  and  which  can,  in  all  soundness  of  convincing argument,  be  urged  and  claimed  as  a  right.  They  are  rendering  high  service  to  the  country,  in  the  stupendous conflict  which  is  now  stirring  the  nation  to  its  foundations,  by  their  presence  on  the  field’  and  shall  they  be denied  a  voice  at  the  ballot-box,  where  preeminently  the  measures  which  are  to  affect,  for  weal  or  woe,  these great and pending issues must of a necessity be decided. None, more  than  they,  have  a  vital  interest  in  these  great  questions,  none  have  a  higher  appreciation  of  the merits  involved. Ours  are  no  hireling  soldiery, who  blindly  execute  the will  of  superiors, without  knowing  for what  they  fight. They have gone  from among  the sovereign people,  intelligent freemen, constituent elements of the government, to contend for a cause in which they have a personal interest, and to maintain principles which, when  the  contest  is  finally  closed,  will  affect  them  in  common  with  all  the  rest,  and  are  fully  entitled  to  the privilege of exercising this right. Proudly  do  we  this  day  recall  the  high  deeds  of  valor  of  our  gallant  sons  and  brethren.  Nobly  have  they sustained  the well  earned  fame  of  their Green Mountain  State. With  unfaltering  courage  and  heroic  endurance have they borne themselves in every contest, and whether on the tented field, or in the dreaded hospital, whether on  the  long  and  weary  march,  or  before  the  murderous  fire  of  traitor  bands,  everywhere  and  under  all circumstances,  have  they  borne  themselves with  veteran  intrepidity;  shrinking  from  no  dangers,  quailing  under no assaults, but attesting their prowess in every battle, and adding fresh and still brighter laurels to the name and fame of their noble State. But  sadly  do  we  turn  to  the  Heroic  Dead!  Softly  would  we  touch  the  strings  that  vibrate  only  to  plaintive notes,  –  Husband!  Father!  Brother!  Son!  The  loved,  the  fondly  cherished!  Nobly  have  they  fallen,  and  in  a glorious  cause. Their  country  called,  and  in  the  great  cause  of Humanity,  they  died,  and  though  their  bones  lie bleaching on a distant  soil,  far away  from home and  friends, yet ever  fresh will be  their memories  in  the hearts of the living and the loved.  “ ’T were sweet, indeed, to close our eyes With those we cherished near, And wafted upward by their sighs, Soar to some calmer sphere; But whether on the scaffold high, Or in the battle’s van, The fittest place for man to die Is where he dies for man.” THE COUNTRY. In  no  doubtful  sense,  is  Vermont  the  uncompromising  foe  of  tyranny  and  oppression,  in  whatever  form  or wherever  it  exist.  Free,  as  the  air  of  her  native  hills,  in  all  her  own  institutions  and  policies,  she  has  ever advocated  the  great  principles  of  Constitutional  Liberty,  in  their  broadest  sense,  and  maintained  them  with unwavering  fidelity,  yet  adhering  steadfastly  TO  THE  Union  in  all  its  integrity.  It  was  this  that  actuated  her, when  at  the  outbreak  of  the  war,  the  first  of  all  the  States,  she  threw  off  the  shackles  of  party,  and  declared herself  unqualifiedly  for  the Constitution  and  the Union,  and  for  sustaining  the Administration  in  all  its  efforts to  suppress  the  rebellion. Applying  no  test  of  political  faith,  but  loyalty  to  the Government,  and  yet,  in  all  this yielding  up  none  of  the  great  cardinal  principles,  for which  she  has  for  years  so  faithfully  contended. Hence  it was,  that  when  the  proclamation  for  the  emancipation  of  the  slaves  was  promulgated,  she  hailed  the  measure with  extreme  satisfaction,  not  only  as  a  military  necessity,  but  as  a  harbinger  of  the  great  work  of  ultimate destruction to that institution, which has been the origin and cause of all our national troubles. The  progress  of  events within  the  past  year,  in  the  struggle which  now  involves  the  country,  has  been  such as  to  call  forth  our  devout  gratitude  to Him who  controls  the  affairs  and  destinies  of  nations. We  are  permitted to enter upon our labors at this time under brighter auspices and more cheering hopes than when we met here, as a  legislature,  one  year  ago.  Then  the  clouds  hung  portentously  over  our  national  affairs.  Since  then,  victories have  taken  the  place  of  defeat,  confidence  has  succeeded  to  despondency  and  distrust,  and  the  power  of  the government  is  being  felt  and  demonstrated,  as  one  stronghold  after  another  of  the  rebellion  is  giving way,  and its limits and boundaries are being narrowed and circumscribed. But while we  thus  indulge  joy  at  the  brightening  prospect,  let  us  not  be  unmindful  of  the  burdens  yet  to  be borne, the sacrifices yet to be made, and the work yet to be accomplished, before we are permitted to enter upon the full and perfect realization of a peace, permanent in its character, a government restored to its pristine power and  authority,  strengthened  and  purified  by  the  ordeal  through  which  it  has  been  called  to  pass,  and  rendered dearer  to  the  hearts  of  all  its  subjects,  by  the  new  and  added  cost  of  treasure  and  blood,  which  have  been expended in redeeming it from the assaults of treason, and the machinations of ambitious and designing men. Reposing with humble faith  in  the power of an Almighty Ruler  to work out his own plan and purposes, and earnestly entreating Him, that he will forgive all our great national sins, and speedily re-establish us, as a nation, wherein  shall dwell peace and righteousness,  let us steadfastly adhere  to  the great principles of our  fathers, and yield  to  the government  all  the  aids  and  encouragements which  it  is  in our power  to  furnish, whether by  active an material  assistance, or by  the no  less powerful  agency of  loyal  and hearty  sympathy. Let us guard ourselves against  the  insidious  efforts  of  disloyal men  for  a  dishonorable  peace,  and  firmly  resolve  to  endure  to  the  end, until  the  last  vestige  of  treason  is  effaced,  and  the  rightful  authority  of  the  Federal  arm  is  fully  asserted  and willingly  confessed  throughout  each  rebellious  district,  and  the  people  thereof  brought  into  complete subordination to its power and rule. Senators and Gentlemen of the House: Upon  you  as  the  exponents  of  a  free  and  sovereign  people will  devolve  the  high  duties  of  contributing  in  a legislative  form  to  the  further  and  more  efficient  support  of  the  national  government.  As  one  of  the  great sisterhood  of  States,  Vermont  has,  through  you,  to  utter  with  still  higher  power  her  allegiance  to  the  Federal Government,  to  express  her  willingness  to  endure  all  needed  burdens,  to  lay  upon  the  sacred  altar  of  our common  country  the  world  that  she  still  maintains,  in  its  highest  devotion,  her  love  for  the  great  principles  of “Freedom and Unity.” In no partisan  spirit,  therefore, and with a high  resolve  to admit of no disturbing elements,  let us each enter upon our  respective duties, and with mutual  forbearance, as co-laborers  in a great cause, discharge  them with a faithful regard to the best interests of our commonwealth. J.G. SMITH  EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, Montpelier, Oct. 9, 1863.
