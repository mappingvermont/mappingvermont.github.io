Inaugural address of  Lee E. Emerson  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1953  Thursday, January 8, 1953 Inaugural Address  TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND PEOPLE OF VERMONT: Two  years  ago  when  I  addressed  this  body,  we  were  engaged  in  undeclared  war  in  Korea.    That  situation still  continues  today.    Our  nation  is  experiencing  heavy  casualties  and  presently  there  appears  to  exist  a stalemate.   We  have  not  yet  come  to  grips with  the  real  enemy.   A war  of  attrition  still  goes  on,  destructive  of our manpower and highly damaging  to our economy  in  the  long  run.   A war economy  is a  false economy.   The only  sound economy  for us  is  in  the utilization of our great productive capacity  to  its  limit  in  the production of peace-time consumer goods  to satisfy our own domestic consumption needs and by  the development of  foreign markets where we can dispose of production not needed for ourselves.  Armistice  negotiations  have  been  fruitless  and  have  presently  broken  down.    Up  to  now  the  only  feasible plan  to  end  the  war  quickly  has  been  discarded  and  the  gallant  soldier  who  proposed  it  summarily  relieved  of his  command.   We  hope  the  future will  hold  out more  promise  than  that of  a  stalemate, but  if bolder  and more aggressive action  is  to be  taken,  it must be understood  the  risk of all-out war may become greater and what we can do on the home front substantially affected thereby. In  effect,  conditions  today  roughly  parallel  those  of  two  years  ago.    Uncertainty  still  prevails.    A  new national  administration  will  soon  go  into  power.    It  has  talked  about  substantial  cuts  in  the  military  budget  to give  the  people  tax  relief.    If  such  cuts  are  made,  this  might  mean  a  decision  for  a  less  aggressive  policy  in Korea,  with  the  war  of  attrition  to  continue.    On  the  other  hand,  if  more  aggressive  measures  are  to  be  taken, and  the  solvency  of  the  government  to  be  maintained  at  the  same  time,  it  means  greater  tax  burdens  at  the national level on you and me, with probable curtailment of some state programs and policies. One  condition,  however,  has  grown  steadily  worse  since  two  years  ago  namely:  inflation.    The  dollar  will not  go  as  far  today  as  it  would  then.    This  means  increased  costs  of  government,  and  explains  why  all  state budgets  are  up  and  will  continue,  unless  the  people  want  to  throw  overboard  some  of  the  traditional responsibilities of government, which I assume they are not ready to yet. Since  this message  is  in  part  an  account  of my  stewardship  for  the  last  two  years,  let me  first  discuss with you  briefly  what  has  been  done  by  your  state  government  to  prepare  ourselves  to  meet  those  uncertainties, which the nature of the times has cast upon us.  MEETING RESPONSIBILITIES IMPOSED BY ABNORMAL WORLD CONDITIONS Civil Defense.  It was recommended, and the 1951 Legislature adopted, Civil Defense legislation.  Included within  it  were  extraordinary  powers  given  the  governor  in  event  of  war  emergency.    Fortunately,  we  have  not had to use any of those powers, and hope that we will not have to.  An efficient Civil Defense program has been set  up  in  the  State,  and  it  is  my  earnest  belief  it  should  be  continued  with  an  adequate  appropriation,  as  at present.    So  long  as  a  war  of  attrition  goes  on  with  the  intentions  of  a  powerful  and  potential  aggressor  as uncertain as they were before the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor, we must remain organized on the home front, and  programs  and  policies  implemented  so  that  the  civilian  population  will  know  in  some  substantial  degree how to take care of itself and others under war emergency or disaster conditions. In  checking  on  the  Civil  Defense  acts  of  other  states,  I  learn  that  Vermont  is  unique  in  certain  respects: particularly with  reference  to  not  recognizing  inter-state  cooperation  in  the  event  of  natural  disaster.   You may want  to  amend  and  enlarge  the  scope  of  Vermont’s  participation  with  her  sister  states  in  the  matter  of  Civil Defense, so as to bring our State in line with the type of legislation adopted in other states. Although  there  are  those  who  believe  that  our  efforts  in  any  civil  defense  program  are  wholly  unneeded because there is no imminent danger of attack, I do not subscribe to such a philosophy, neither do I believe you do.    Civil  Defense,  so  long  as  our  most  powerful  enemy  follows  a  policy  of  watchful  waiting,  would  seem  to have  become  a  part  of  our  way  of  life,  and  our  activity  in  that  respect  not  to  be  diminished  or  looked  upon lightly until the present threat to world peace shall cease to exist. Military.  The 1951 session, on my recommendation, authorized the setting up of a state guard and provided an  appropriation  of  $50,000  to  put  it  into  operation.      The  act  should  be  continued  as  a  protective  measure.  Although  we  did  not  set  up  the  state  guard  as  authorized,  still  it  was  very  essential  legislation  for  the  1951 session  to  adopt,  because Vermont  lost  practically  all  of  its National Guard when  it was  activated  into  Federal service as part of  the 43rd Division.   We did not put  the state guard organization  into effect  for  two  reasons:  (1) There  was  no  equipment  in  the  line  of  arms  and  ammunition  available  from  any  source,  including  the  Federal government;  neither  could  uniforms  be  procured  from  the  Federal  government,  and  if  provided, would  have  to be provided at state expense, and (2) by vigorously picturing our plight to the Federal government, we were able to have assigned to the State additional national guard units to take the place of those which had been activated. The  new  allocation  to  the  State  of  the  124th  Anti-aircraft  Artillery  Battalion  and  the  progress  made  in  the organization  of  that  unit,  together  with  units  remaining  in  the  State,  have    brought  us  up  to  a  strength approximating  800.   All  these  units  are  given  thorough  training  in  the  basic  fundamentals  of  fully  protecting  a civilian population in the event of war emergency or disaster.  They are well scattered through out the state and are steadily being brought up to maximum strength. I  have  inspected  our  National  Guard  units  on  several  occasions  during  their  training  and  field  camps,  and have seen  the  troops  in  review.   Their morale  is good;  they are eager  to  learn and could give a good account of themselves if necessary. Federal  expenditures  on  the National Guard  of Vermont,  both  for  the Army  and  the Air,  in  the  fiscal  years 1951 and 1952 exceeded one million dollars, and included in that amount are the drill and field training pay for the Guard for these years.  Federal support, naturally, was less than average because of the reduced strengths of our Guard. I desire to commend highly our elements of the 43rd Division, which included the 172 Infantry and the 206th Field Artillery Battalion, as well as the 134th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, for their contribution to our national defense, and I also want to commend the National Guard which remained in our State and the units which were organized  for  their  part  in  providing  for  our  internal  security  while  the  bulk  of  our  National  Guard  was  in  the Federal  service.    It  is very necessary  that we maintain our State  forces  for  internal  and national  security during these times when world conditions are in such a troubled state. Soldiers’  Bonus.    A  Soldiers’  Bonus  law  was  also  enacted  providing  for  bonus  payments  to  those  in military service, the same as to veterans of World War I and World War II.  Our State was the first in the Union to begin processing claims under this law.  An appropriation of $250,000 to implement the payments was made for  the  biennium.    This  has  already  been  exhausted,  and  it  will  be  necessary,  because  of  the  heavy  rate  of discharge of men, especially from the 43rd Division, to recommend to you a deficiency appropriation, so that the bonus payments may be made  to  all veterans  entitled  to  them up  to  June 30, 1953.    I  firmly believe because of the  precedent  established  in  the  case  of  World  Wars  I  and  II  veterans,  we  should  continue  these  bonus payments. Election Laws for Soldiers.  The election laws were also modified by the 1951 session so as to provide for voting  by  our  soldier  boys  scattered  as  they may  be  to  the  far-flung  corners  of  the  earth.   A  grateful  electorate can do no  less  than  to  facilitate  in every way possible  the exercise of  the  franchise by  those  in military  service, because its free exercise is one of the very things that we must be continually vigilant to preserve. This  law  worked  out  fairly  well  during  the  last  national  election.    However,  you  may  want  to  give  some consideration  to  advancing  the  date  of  the  primary  in  1953  to  provide more  time  for  the  distribution  of  ballots and for voting in the general election of that year. ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS A  second  objective  was  to  give  the  people  of  Vermont  honest  and  efficient  operation  of  their  government and  to  endeavor  to  promote  economies  that  would  accomplish  that  purpose  wherever  possible.    We  have maintained  the  high  credit  standing  of  the  state  and  have  stayed  within  the  budget  limits,  with  but  very  few exceptions.  Operating  a  state  government  in  these  inflationary  times  by  meeting  needs  and  at  the  same  time keeping  expenditures  within  bounds  is  no  easy  task.    Basically,  it  is  part  of  the  fundamentals  of  good government,  that  sound  and  economical  administration  plus  the  revenues  the  legislature  provides  should substantially  result  in  revenues  balancing  out  expenditures,  but  this  is  a  difficult  matter  to  gauge  accurately  at best.  Let me elaborate on this entire theme in some specific detail. Code for Classification of payments.  I asked the 1951 session to authorize the coding of the classification of payments made by our various administrative departments and that session complied with my request.  It has been my feeling that the adoption of such a code has resulted in a saving of several hundred thousand dollars of expenditures  in  the  various  departments  because  administrative  heads  have  been most  helpful  and  cooperative in  more  carefully  budgeting  their  expenses  in  the  various  categories  and  in  endeavoring  to  keep  their expenditures within the limits fixed. Out-of-State  Travel.    Likewise,  I  have  endeavored  to  curtail  expenditures  in  the  public  interest  where  I thought  that  they might  be  desirable  but  not  absolutely  necessary.    In  this  connection,  I might  say  that  out-of-state  travel by department heads and others had begun  to assume substantial proportions.   Out-of-state  travel  in 1951 amounted  to over $50,000.   By adopting an  informal rule  limiting out-of-state  travel  to a specific amount, I have found that this has resulted in quite a substantial saving in department operations. Expert Assistance.       The  1951  session  also  gave me  an  appropriation  of  $15,000  to  hire  expert  assistance to  look  into  the  workings  of  our  state  government  with  a  view  to  promoting  economies  where  they  could  be made. Griffenhagen  &  Associates  were  hired  to  make  that  study,  and  they  have  made  up  an  extensive  summary report  embodying  their  suggestions  and  recommendations.    I  hope  you  will  give  careful  thought,  study,  and attention  to  the  summary  and  see  to  it  that  those  suggestions  and  recommendations  are  implemented  in  the public  interest  to  the  extent  you  think  they  are  applicable  and  necessary  here  in  Vermont.    Many  of  these suggestions not requiring legislation have been put into effect and are now being followed. Reclassification  Plan.    Ten  years  ago  a  state  pay  plan  for  employees  in  the  administrative  and  executive branches of state government was adopted.   It  is not adequate  today by reason of  the changing  times.   The plan has  become  considerably  distorted,  and  make-shift  arrangements  resorted  to  in  order  to  make  it  all  adaptable, resulting in many glaring inequalities in state pay to employees.  The 1951 legislature recognized the fact when I granted the $9 per week increase, a measure which accentuated the problem and did not solve it. It  seemed  imperative  therefore,  in  accordance  with  good  administration  that  a  new  study  be  made  with  a view  to  a  proper  reclassification  of  jobs  and  pay.    Griffenhagen  &  Associates  were  hired  by  me  to  make  that study.    They  have  spent  months  of  exhaustive  research  on  the  subject  studying  state  jobs,  have  compared  our pay scales with other states and with the wages and salaries paid by private industry in Vermont.  Recently, they have come out with a report which has been furnished you.  It will require some adjustments which we feel can be  made  to  properly  relate  it  to  our  conditions.    I  feel  these  can  be  made.    Its  adoption,  except  as  to  statutory salaries,  should  be  an  administrative  function.    I  approve  it  under  the  conditions mentioned  above  and  request that you appropriate the necessary funds to implement it, after you have given due consideration to whether you want  to go along with  the statutory salary  increases as recommended,  in  the report.   As to the  increase  in salary for  the  governor,  I  request,  if  you  approve  it  as  recommended,  it  not  be made  operative  during  the  term  of  the present incumbent. While on  this matter of pay  for personnel in  the state service,  it might not be amiss  to state  that Vermont at the present time has adopted quite an elaborate civil service system for a state as small as ours.  This system has seen  many  changes  and  enlargements  in  the  course  of  the  last  few  years.    It  might  be  said  because  of  these factors that we have been experiencing growing pains in its development.  Some inconsistencies are to be found in the law because of that rapid growth:  for instance, Section 490 of the Vermont statutes provides in substance that  the  “state  treasurer,  secretary  of  state,  auditor  of  accounts  and  attorney  general  may  each  employ  and discharge at pleasure such assistants, clerical or otherwise as they deem necessary to maintain and execute their respective offices, and with the approval of the governor, fix the compensation to be paid therefor.” This  section  seems  to  be  at  variance  with  Section  513  of  the  Vermont  Statutes  authorizing  the  governor through  the  Personnel  Board  and  the  Personnel  Director,  to  adopt  and  establish  a  plan  of  classification  and compensation for employment in the state government. Then  there  is  the matter of  recent  legislatures setting up new departments of Government and providing  for the  hiring  of  directors  and  employees  without  reference  to  the  state  classification  plan  envisioned  by  Section 513.    These  conflicts  and  inconsistencies  need  clarification.   My  own  feeling  is  that,  especially  in  the  case  of elective officers,  they must have some  leeway  in  the selection of  their key personnel, untrammeled by  the  rules and regulations of civil service, if the elective official is to be assured of loyalty in his department and sympathy with his programs and policies. Surplus.  You are aware the state ended the last fiscal year with the largest surplus in its history.  A surplus against  an  emergency  is  a  fortunate  position  in  which  to  be.   We  will  undoubtedly  end  the  present  fiscal  year with  another  surplus, but of  considerably  reduced  size.   At  least $3,000,000 of non-recurring  revenue  available in  the  fiscal year  ending  June 30, 1952 will not be  available  this  fiscal  year.    I will deal with  the disposition of this surplus in detail in my budget message, but a few thoughts with reference to the same might not be amiss at this time.  The surplus came about because of four principal reasons: 1.  Imposition  of  the  15%  surtax which  automatically  expired December  31,  1952.    I  see  no  reason for  its  re-enactment  and  in  fact,  no  reason  for  any  imposition  of  additional  taxes  on  the  people  of  this state. 2.  The 1951 legislature, late in the session, changed the rules of the game as to the time and method of  payment  of  income  taxes,  therefore  creating  considerable  uncertainty  as  to  how  this  change  in  the rules would affect the revenue picture. Withholding  was  such  a  change.    This  resulted  in  a  windfall,  or  fifth  quarter  payment  of  income taxes;  also  corporations were  required  to  pay  in  full with  the  filing  of  their  returns  on  last May  15,  and we picked up thereby one full year’s tax, plus balances owed for prior years. 3.  Prudent  conduct  of  the  affairs  of  the  state  by  this  administration  accounted  for  several  hundred thousand dollars of that surplus, and 4.  The  impetus  given  to  business  as  a  result  of  the  Korean  conflict,  and  its  attendant  stimulating effect upon state income tax payments greatly augmented our revenues.   The impact of this conflict was impossible to foresee. As you know, I did not call a special session  to repeal  the 15% surtax  law, and refund  this  tax  to  the people for  the  calendar year 1952.    I  felt  there was nothing which  a  special  session of  the 1951  legislature  could do  in this  respect which  you  also meeting  in  regular  session  now  could  not  do,  having  in mind  the  over-all  needs  of the state for the coming biennium, without the attendant expense of a special session. You  might  feel  that  because  we  have  a  large  surplus,  there  should  be  some  further  tax  relief.    In  this connection, however, I call your attention to the Meredith Report, which has been drawn up and submitted by a distinguished group of Vermonters.   This  report  in my opinion  is a monumental piece of work dealing with  the finances of the state in every particular, and should be of great help and assistance to you in this session, and as a source book of material for the guidance of future legislators for many years to come. Of  its  recommendations  and  conclusions  on  the  matter  of  finances  and  taxation,  I  bespeak  your  careful consideration, and also its message with reference to tax relief. With  further  reference  to  the  refunding  to  the  taxpayers  surplus monies which may not be necessary  for  the ordinary  expenses  of  government,  a  plan  should  be  adopted  whereby  there  could  be  refunds  without  the necessity of calling a special session, if it is the wise and politic thing to do. At one  time,  I advocated  leaving  this matter  in  the hands of  the Emergency Board.   The State of New York has  endeavored  to  handle  the  problem  through  fixing  by  statute  flat  percentage  credits  to  be  taken  by  the  taxpayer on his income tax.  Virginia provides in substance where the general fund revenues of the State exceed a  certain  amount,  the  governor  by  proclamation,  may  take  cognizance  of  that  fact  and  order  an  automatic  tax credit  fixed  percentage-wise  by  statute  to  go  into  effect  and  be  rebated  to  the  taxpayer.    The  percentage  of refund  grows  as  the  revenue  of  the  state  may  exceed  certain  fixed  amounts.    I  feel  you  should  give  careful consideration  to  the  adoption  of  legislation  that  will  implement  one  of  these  plans  in  the  interest  of  the taxpayers. I might say also in conclusion on this subject of the surplus, I agree in principle that it should not be used in setting up new programs calling for recurring taxation.  What are recurring programs may, however, be difficult to determine in practice. Central  Registration  Bureau.    One  final  thought  while  on  the  subject  matter  covered  under  the  general heading is this.  We have created many boards and agencies in the State to look after the professional needs and qualifications of their respective memberships.  Cosmetology, accountancy, engineering, real estate and barbers constitute  but  a  few.    I  recommend  a  committee  be  authorized  and  appointed  by  this  legislature  to  study  this situation with  a  view  to  determining  if  one  central  board  of  registration  is  better  and more  economical  for  our needs, and report its findings and recommendations to the next legislature. TRADITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES I  turn  now  to  a  discussion  of  some  of  those  subjects which  over  a  period  of  years  have  apparently  become fixed in the peoples’ minds as responsibilities with which to be dealt. Education.    I  recommend  that  the  minimum  pay  of  teachers  be  raised  in  accordance  with  the  formula  as devised  by  the State Board  of Education,  and  that  the  cost  of  raising  such  standards  to  the  fixed  recommended minimums,  estimated  at $138,000  a year, be  contributed  to  the municipalities by  the State  through  the medium of  increasing  the  state  aid  thereto.    However,  some  flexibility  must  be  provided.    Providing  fixed  minimum salaries by  legislative  fiat  should not be absolute and arbitrary, or  interfere with  the  liberty of  contract between teachers and school board at different rates, if the commissioner, in his discretion, felt it was in the best interests of the state to allow some deviation from a fixed schedule. Careful  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  matter  of  school  house  construction.    Vermont  must  proceed wisely and cautiously in this respect.  I say this because I have in mind several years ago, on recommendation of the State Board of Education, many rural schools were remodeled and improved  to standard or superior schools at  thousands  of  dollars  of  expense  to  the  taxpayers  in  the  various  towns,  and  today  these  schools  are  closed  up and abandoned by the lack of children to attend them in the vicinity in which they were located. I  further  have  in  mind  that  a  constitutional  amendment  is  in  the  offing  authorizing  several  towns  to  band together  for  the construction and maintenance of a consolidated elementary school which cannot be done  today because  of  constitutional  restrictions.    Although  it  might  be  desirable  to  build  a  consolidated  school  in  a particular  town,  from  the  long-range point of view,  it might be more desirable  to build a consolidated school  in the area  that would accommodate  several  towns.   The  recommendation of  the  special committee created by  the Board  of  Education,  to  look  into  the  matter  of  school  house  construction,  placing  emphasis  on  union  high school  construction,  you may  consider  to  be  a  practical  one under  the  circumstances,  and  clearly  stating where the emphasis should be placed at  this  time. You may  further deem  it advisable  to provide  that matching money be  made  available  by  the  State  on  a  limited  basis  of  say,  25%  state  funds  to  75%  local  funds,  as  an  aid  in stimulating  this  kind  of  construction.   We must  remember,  however,  that  if  it  is  determined  the  state's  credit  is to  be  pledged  for  school  house  construction  in  any  way,  we  must  plan  wisely  and  cautiously  for  the  future.  Vermont  has  no  money  to  throw  away.    Economic  factors,  transportation,  trends  in  school  population,  the potential  destiny  of  an  area  should  all  be  weighed  and  considered  carefully  by  a  practical,  disinterested  and competent group before any approval for construction is given. The  union  high  school  district  law  should  also  be  clarified  and  amended  so  as  to  fulfill  effectively  the purpose for which it was intended. Likewise,  a  committee  was  authorized  by  the  1951  session  to  study  the  factors  involved  in  the  higher education of Vermont youth, and  the report of  this committee is now available  to you.   It  is quite an exhaustive one and  should be carefully  studied.    I  shall endeavor  to deal with certain of  the  subject matter of  this  report  in my budget message,  feeling as  I do  that some additional support might very well be given  to Vermont youth as a  greater  inducement  to  attend  a  Vermont  college.    This  report  seems  to  dovetail  in  some  degree  with  the budgetary  requests  of  the University  of Vermont  and State Agricultural College, which  I will  deal  further with in the budget message. Highways.    The  Highway  Department  has  done  an  outstanding  job  during  the  last  two  years,  with  limited engineering  personnel,  in  going  ahead  with  a  highway  construction  program  in  keeping  our  main  lines  in  a proper state of repair, and in providing adequate winter maintenance.  I want to see this good work continued.  I am  committed  to  the  policy  of matching  all  Federal  funds.   The  gravel  gaps  in  our  state  and  state-aid  highway system  I  want  to  see  closed  up  just  as  rapidly  as  our  financial  circumstances  will  permit.    The  matter  of  an adequate highway program will be further dealt with in the budget message. Agriculture.   Legal  restrictions  against  the  sale  of  colored  oleo  in Vermont  should  now  be  removed.    I  do feel,  however,  that  an  intensive  program  of  research  and  advertising  aimed  at  stimulating  the  purchase  of milk and  milk  products  by  the  consuming  public  is  very  worthy  of  sympathetic  consideration  by  this  legislature.  Dairying  is  the  backbone  of  our  agricultural  economy,  and we  certainly want  to  see  it  kept  healthy  and  strong.  Increased  consumption  of  milk  and  milk  products  is  one  way  to  accomplish  this  end.    Furthermore,  honest labeling,  packaging  and  selling  of  synthetic  dairy  products  should  be  provided,  so  that  consumers  will  at  all times  know  exactly  the  type  of  product  they  are  buying.   We  in  Vermont must  always  be  vigilant  and  alert  to anything  which  would  adversely  affect  our  dairy  industry.    Consideration  should  also  be  given  to  whether circumstances  in Vermont  do  not  now warrant  a  compulsory  calfhood  vaccination  program  for  the  eradication of  Bang’s  disease.    Funds  have  been  provided  in  the  budget  for  setting  up  a  testing  laboratory  in  the  southern part of the State to service the needs of the farmers in that area. Health.    As  you  know,  the  1951  session  transferred  the  Brandon  State  School,  Vermont  Sanatorium, Washington  County  Sanatorium  and  the  Vermont  State  Hospital  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Department  of Institutions.    They  have  been  well  administered  there  during  the  past  two  years,  and  I  recommend  that  they remain under the control of the Department of Institutions. I  might  say  also  that  the  State  Health  Laboratory  difficulty  was  ironed  out  by  the  1951  session.  Construction  is  proceeding  according  to  schedule,  and  it  will  be  ready  for  occupancy  in  the  summer  of  1953.  Such a building was necessary and  it can be well and effectively used  in carrying on the health programs of  the State.  You will be asked early in the session for an additional appropriation of $20,000 to restore some features left  out  when  the  1951  session  did  not  authorize  an  extra  $75,000  appropriation.    I  feel  this  request  should  be granted. I have provided  in my budget for more public health nurses, because I feel  that  they are vitally necessary  to the health of our people.   Also  a dental hygiene division  should be  set up  in order  that  the  teeth of  the children of the state can be better looked after than they are at present.  Provision is also made for this in my budget. I  also  feel  it would be desirable  to use  the  facilities of  the State Hospital  at Waterbury  for  the  furnishing of psychiatric  training  for  girls  who  are  taking  nurses’  training  courses.    Today  many  girls  leave  the  state  to  get their nurses’ training, because they cannot receive this phase of it in Vermont. The Commission authorized by the 1951 session to make a study of the needs for more plant facilities at the State Hospital  at Waterbury has made  an outstanding  contribution on  the  subject matter of  the  chronically  ill.  I commend  its report  in  this respect  to your favorable consideration, and also feel  that  its other recommendations are likewise in the public interest and should be adopted to the fullest extent possible. Welfare.   A  so-called  pauper  commission was  authorized  by  the  1951  session  and  its  report  is  available  to you.    The  Commission  is  to  be  commended  for  its  effort.    Its  principal  recommendation  is  that  the  cost  of hospitalization  of  the  indigent poor be borne by  the  state.   Such  a  recommendation,  if  followed, would  embark us upon a new and unchartered course, and would present many grave and unusual administrative problems. The  hospitals  have  carried  some  expenditures  for  indigent  care  that  have  not  been  met.    It  is  generally recognized  that  the  hospitals  of  the  State  have  difficulty  in  meeting  their  financial  obligations  from  current receipts. The  principal  problem  at  the  local  level  appears  to  be  the  impact  of  unexpected,  uncontrollable  heavy expense for hospitalization.  This sometimes leads to financial obligations in excess of the ability of some of the communities  of  the  State  to  finance  from  local  taxes,  thereby  creating  an  inequitable  burden  at  times.    But,  to remove  the entire expense of  these  items  from  local  scrutiny and  responsibility, and place  it  in  the hands of  the State would  inaugurate  a  continuing  and  increasingly  heavy  financial  policy  and  obligation.    Judging  from  the experience of the past, it is a program that would grow in scope and require greater amounts of money from the State treasury. I  believe  the  legislature  should  explore  all  possible  alternative  policies  which  would  remove  the  factor  of unpredictability leading to inequitable burdens, before the State is committed to a program of complete financial responsibility. To  that  end,  if  you,  after  weighting  all  factors,  decide  you  want  to  do  something  about  it,  I  would  suggest that when a  town or city has expended  taxwise more  than a certain average portion of  taxes raised based on  the last  ten years’ experience  in all  towns and cities for hospitalization,  that a portion of  the burden, on a graduated rate  basis,  be  transferred  to  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare,  and  an  appropriation  therefore  be  authorized.  Some local responsibility must at all times be maintained. Such a plan, if adopted, would at least be a better one than having the Federal government pre-empt the field as it has done to a large degree with other welfare programs. Likewise,  a  commission  was  authorized  to  look  into  the  matter  of  juvenile  delinquency.    Its  report  is available to you, and should have your careful consideration. I  recommend  the  adoption  of  the  uniform  Reciprocal  Enforcement  of  Support  Act,  and  greater  authority being given the Department of Social Welfare to compel delinquent parents, when able to support their children, and delinquent adult children, when able, to support their aged parents. Development  Commission.    Two  years  ago,  I  recommended  a  scale  down  of  the  Vermont  Development Commission activity because  I  felt  its record  in promoting  the  recreational,  industrial and agricultural economy of  the  State  was  unimpressive  and  ineffectual.    Today  under  new  and  vigorous  leadership,  I  feel  that  situation has  changed,  and  that  the  Development  Commission  can  now  do  a  good  job  in  substantially  promoting  and benefiting  the  economy  of  our  State.    There  is  need  for  such  a  program,  where  vision  to  see  our  possibilities exists and the resourcefulness to improve them is also present. The  Commission  has  formulated  plans  for  the  setting  up  with  private  funds  of  a  Development  Credit Corporation, similar to that which has worked effectively in the State of Maine.  I recommend that the necessary enabling legislation be passed to give it proper legal status.  Likewise it vigorously seeks to promote the sale of Vermont  products,  and  to  aid  in  selling  Vermont  recreationally  as  well.    These  plans  are  entitled  to  your sympathetic consideration. Conservation.  This subject covers a broad scope, and I shall attempt to deal with it only to a limited degree in this message. In  the  field of  forestry,  the municipal  enabling  act  adopted by  the 1951  session on my  recommendation has been  very  helpful.  Many  municipalities  have  acquired  lands  for  forest  purposes  while  others  have  set  up committees  to  study  such  a  plan.    Listers,  becoming more  fully  aware  all  the  time  of  the  necessity  for  a  broad over-all land classification set up for tax purposes, are cooperating in such classification.  This is as it should be.  The nature and extent of forest land, or potential forest land, existent in the state, must first be known before an adequate  plan  of  exempting  forest  lands  from  taxation  as  a  stimulus  to  conservation  of  this  great  natural resource can be safely embarked upon. As  to  pollution,  we  are  slowly  but  surely  going  ahead  with  our  classification  of  waters.    The  lakes  and streams of Vermont constitute a great natural asset we must do our best to preserve unsullied, if we should make of Vermont the recreational paradise in the summertime we claim it to be. Vermont  legislatures  in  the  past  have  been  requested  to  adopt  a  regulatory  powers  act  to  take  care  of  fish and game matters by commission fiat, rather than by legislation.  New Hampshire has attempted such a program to a  limited degree  in  the case of  fish.   You should study  the New Hampshire operation carefully  to get  the full benefit of that state’s experience in deciding upon the feasibility of such legislation for Vermont. Fire  prevention  is  likewise  a  species  of  conservation.    The  property  losses  in  Vermont  from  this  cause amount  to  several  hundred  thousand  dollars  each  year.    The  report  of  a  special  committee  dealing  with  this subject  should be given careful consideration by you, as well as greater  stress being placed on  the education of the young in this regard. Labor  and Unemployment.     The  relations between  capital  and  labor have  always been good  in Vermont.  We  want  to  continue  to  see  them  that  way.    We  further  feel  that  Vermont  legislatures  have  exercised forbearance  in  the  enactment  of  legislation  which  would  appear  to  be  anti-labor.    This  is  as  it  should  be.  The 1951  session  adopted  an  occupational  disease  law.    Although  not  perfect  by  any  means,  certain  imperfections and weaknesses  in  it  have  come  to  the  surface  as  a  result of  experience  in  its operation,  and  these undoubtedly can be corrected to the mutual satisfaction of both capital and labor. My  attention  has  recently  been  called  to  a  9%  increase  in  the  cost  of Workmen’s Compensation  Insurance.  Undoubtedly  this  is  due  in  some  substantial  degree  to  an  inflationary  rise  in  the  cost  of  medical  and  hospital care  for  the  workmen  injured  in  the  line  of  duty.    I  have  a  lot  of  sympathy  for  the  employer  who  has  to  face continually  these  constantly  changing  and  unfavorable  circumstances.    But  there  should  also,  in  the  light  of these  inflationary  conditions,  be  consideration  given  to  the  adequacy  of  present  hospital  and  medical  benefits for the injured workmen. The Unemployment  Compensation  Law will  have  some minor  changes  to  it  proposed  by  the  Commission, to  which  I  trust  you  will  give  careful  consideration  in  the  interest  of  clarifying  and  improving  it,  the  purpose being to assist in more efficient operation of it. Retirement.    An  orderly  and  fair  plan  for  the  retirement  of  our  superannuated  employees  is  just  as important  to  the  continued  welfare  of  Vermont  as  is  the  recruitment  and  maintenance  of  an  efficient  body  of employees.    I  am  concerned  that  the  retirement  plan  provided  for  our  state  police  and motor  vehicle  inspectors has proven to be basically unsound. I  recommend  that  this matter  be made  the  subject  of  study  by  the Emergency Board  and  that  this Board  be given the power to act if such study leads to what seems to be a proper solution.  I am aware of the fact that the plan provided  for other  employees must be kept up  to date  if we  are  to  continue  to  attract  and keep our  trained employees.    Consequently,  I  recommend  that  the  General  Assembly  seriously  consider  certain  changes proposed  for  the  Vermont  Employee’s  Retirement  System.    The  proposal  for  a  “vested  rights”  amendment seems  only  fair.    The  interchange  of  credits  for  employees  and  members  of  the  State  Teachers’  Retirement System  seems  to  have  merit.    Other  proposed  changes  in  both  employees  and  teachers’  systems  should  be considered  carefully  with  the  thought  that  Vermont  cannot  hope  to  attract  and  keep  capable  employees  and teachers unless it can offer the same security available elsewhere. OTHER MATTERS St.  Lawrence  Seaway.      Indications  are  that  authority  to  develop  the  power  phase  of  the  St.  Lawrence Seaway  project  will  be  forthcoming  before  too  long,  probably  to  the  State  of  New  York  under  the  aegis  of  its New York Power Authority.    If, as, and when,  this project  is developed, whether by  the Federal government or New  York,  Vermont  wants  to  be  sure  to  get  a  fair  allocation  of  the  power  generated  thereat.    The  New  York Power Authority has previously stated  that growing power needs of New York State alone could readily absorb the entire output.  If Vermont is not in a position to receive this power when generated, New York could be very readily  excused  from  setting  aside  any  for  our  use.    In  view  of  this  circumstance, No.  193  of  the Acts  of  1951 constituting  the  Public  Service  Commission  the  bargaining  agency  of  the  state  in  this  respect,  should  be carefully re-examined, and its scope broadened if necessary, to provide assurance for the receipt of such power, if allocated to us, and its distribution as provided by the Act. Public Service Commission.     Recent  rate hearing  cases have  left  the public with  a  sense of  frustration,  in being  unable  to  terminate  them  quickly  in  the  public  interest.    They  are  intricate  and  involved  proceedings,  at best.  There is involved in them the right of a utility to do business at a profit and realize a reasonable return on its investment.  Out of these rate hearings there have developed certain conclusions of the distinguished counsel for the people to which I feel you will give careful and considerate treatment. Among  them  are  these: Definite  statutory  authority  should  be  conferred  on  the Public Service Commission to  determine  rates  and  fix  the  cost  of  depreciation.   The  statutes  against discrimination  in  rate  changing  should be strengthened.   The field should be explored, at  least, on cooperating with our adjoining sister states  in hiring the  necessary  experts  on  a  full-time  basis.    More  time  should  be  given  the  Commission  to  determine  difficult rate cases. Rate making  is  an  intricate  and  exacting  business.    Few  attorneys  in Vermont  are  qualified  by  training  and experience in this field because of its highly specialized nature.  So it is small wonder it is a slow and laborious process at best. Any  practical  suggestions  of  a  committee  provided  for  at  the  Vermont  Bar  Association  meeting  should likewise be given careful consideration by you. Vermont State Prison.     Demag and Blair escaped  from  the Vermont State Prison at Windsor and while at large, brutally assaulted  two  innocent people,  resulting  in  the death of one.   They were captured and now await trial.    I  made  a  personal  investigation  and  report  on  what  happened,  with  recommendations.  The  Emergency Board went along with my recommendations on what needed to be done immediately to make the prison, about the oldest  in  the country, more safe against further escape.   But  the question of what  to do about  the prison as a matter  of  long  range  planning  still  remains.    I  recommend  that  a  committee  be  appointed  to  study  the  situation relative to the need for a new prison plant and report back to the next session of the legislature. CONCLUSION In this message I have endeavored to review briefly my administration and to pose some of the highlights of prospective  legislation  for  your  consideration.    There will  be many  bills  and  resolutions  introduced which will call  for  painstaking  care  and  scrutiny  on  your  part  in  the  best  interests  of  the  State.    You  will  meet  many problems  that  require  investigation  and  fine  judgment  if  they  are  to  be  solved  in  a  permanent  and  satisfactory manner. It  is my  hope  during  the  coming months we  shall hold  steadily  in mind  that we  are not here  as  individuals, responsible  only  to  ourselves,  but  rather  as  public  trustees with  the  duty  to  promote  to  the  extent  of  our  ability the  best  and  highest  welfare  of  all  the  people  of  this  State.   We  must  weigh  carefully  the  benefits  against  the burdens as to new legislation calling for appropriations. You  and  I  have  constitutional  duties  to  perform,  duties  so  closely  related  it  is  only  with  cooperation  and unity  of  purpose  and  action  we  can  hope  to  make  our  state  government  function  effectively.    I  bespeak  your cooperation in these trying times.  You will have mine at all times.   Working together we can make this session harmonious and fruitful in wisely solving the problems and needs of the State at this session.
