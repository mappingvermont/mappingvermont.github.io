Inaugural address of  Asahel Peck  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  Biennial Session,  1874  Friday, October 9, 1874 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen  of the Senate  and House of Representatives: It  is  a  matter  of  congratulation  that  the  period  which  has  called  us  together  to  discharge  the  public  trusts reposed in us under the Constitution, is marked by the general health and prosperity of the people; that the earth has  yielded  its  abundance,  and  industry  is  generally  reaping  its  accustomed  reasonable  reward.   These,  and  the numerous  blessing  which  we  individually,  and  as  a  people,  enjoy,  should  excite  in  us  feelings  of  thankfulness and gratitude to the Giver of all good. Your  powers  and  duties  are  so  comprehensive  and  varied,  that  it would  be  neither  practicable  nor  useful  to attempt, in the accustomed executive communication, to embrace all the subjects that may properly engage your attention, and require your action.           It  is  gratifying  to  find  the  finances  of  the  State  in  the  healthy  and  satisfactory  condition  indicated  by  the Treasurer’s  report,  to which you are  referred  for a more  full and detailed  statement  than  is necessary  to be here repeated.  It appears from the account of the Treasurer, commencing August 1, 1872, that at that date he credits the  State  by  balance  in  treasury,  August  1,  1872,  $178,179.14,  and  by  sinking  fund  in  treasury,  $184,351.02; and  also  during  the  year  commencing  at  the  above  date  and  ending  July  31,  1873,  credits  the  State  numerous items, mostly  from  the ordinary  sources of  revenue,  including $4,386.80  received  from Hon.  J. S. Morrill, U.S. Senator,  and  $7,836.74  received  for  interest  on  balances,  amounting,  exclusive  of  the  two  items  first  above mentioned, to $506,504.08, making credit for the year above mentioned,   $869,034.24 Against this for the same period he charges— For extra State pay of $7 per month, “ allotted United States pay,  “ Auditor’s orders, “ court orders,  “ legislative debentures,56,022.20 “ registered loan redeemed, “ coupon bonds redeemed, “ discount on taxes,   “ interest paid,   To balance this he charges balance of sinking fund, And balance cash in treasury,   Making   $5,404.84      1,165.72 $274,963.89 57,252.14  53,000.00 32,000.00 14,227.52 32,374.34 --------------  $526,410.65   $101,851.02  240,772.57   ----------------   $869,034.24 For  the year  ending  July 31, 1874, he  credits  the State by  the  last  two  items of  charge  in  the  account of  the preceding year, that is— Balance in treasury August 1, 1873, Sinking fund in treasury August 1, 1873,  And  also  by  other  items  in  detail  from  the  usual  sources,  including  $6,328.98  received  from  Quartermaster   $460,380.26 General for military stores sold, amounting, exclusive of the first two items, to     ----------------- Making the credit to the State,   $803,003.85      $240,772.57  101,851.02      $181.93 694.64 11,145.00 15,495.00 ---------------- 12,353.06 $2,764.22 608.90 216,722.94 66,099.60 167.91 $27,471.57 For the year last named, ending July 31, 1874, the Treasurer debits the State —  For extra State pay of $7 per month, “ allotted United States pay,  “ Auditor’s orders, “ court orders,  “ United States surplus fund paid towns, “interest paid on allotment acc’ts, “interest paid towns on U.S. surplus fund, For interest paid on registered loan, “ interest paid on coupons,   For discount on taxes,  Paid on funded debt: Registered loan of 1874,   Registered loan of 1876,        Coupon bonds of 1874, Coupon bonds of 1876,      Coupon bonds of 1878,     Making the debit  Leaving balance in treasury: Sinking fund,  Cash and deposits n banks, subject to check on call,       The Treasurer’s report shows the liabilities and assets of the State as follows:  LIABILITIES. $16,500.00 2,500.00 20,000.00 26,000.00 6,000.00 ----------------- $71,000.00  ------------------   $397,188.20 $37,932.36 367,883.29  ------------------  $405,815.65   -----------------   $803,003.85 Due towns, U.S. surplus fund, Due on soldiers’ accounts, Due on outstanding checks, Due on funded debt: Bonds due Dec. 1, 1874,   Bonds due Dec. 1, 1876,   Bonds due Dec. 1, 1878,   Due Agricultural College fund, June 1, 1890,     Due on tax of 1873,  Cash in treasury and on deposit in banks,     Excess of resources over liabilities,    ASSETS.    $11,519.96 13,424.46 1,886.06 $50,500.00 110,500.00 65,500.00 ---------------  $226,500.00  135,500.00   -----------------   $338,830.48 $5,671.44 405,815.65 ----------------  $411,487.09   -----------------  $22,656.61    Of the above liabilities it appears that $194,000 is in outstanding coupon bonds payable $50,500.00   December 1, 1874, 109,500.00   December 1, 1876,   December 1, 1878, 34,000.00  ----------------  $194,000.00   And that $168,000 of the above liabilities is in outstanding “certificates of registered loan,” issued under the act of 1867, and act of 1870, which sum includes the Agricultural College Fund.  These certificates are payable: $   1,000.00   December 1, 1876,   December 1, 1878,  31, 500.00 $135,500.00 June 1, 1890, Agricultural College Fund   -----------------  $168,000.00  In providing for  the necessary revenues, and  in  the appropriations for  the ensuing  two years, I would advise that provision be made to meet, at maturity, the $110,500 of the funded debt which is payable Dec. 1, 1876. Little  need  be  said  on  the  subject  of  education;  since,  by  common  consent,  its  importance  is  acknowledged in  the  preservation  of  virtue  and  prevention  of  vice,  and  in  promoting,  in  many  ways,  the  general  peace, prosperity  and  happiness  of  the  people;  and  since  it  is  as  universally  conceded  that,  in  order  to  be  effectual,  it must be general among  the people, and be disseminated among all classes by  the most efficient agency  for  that purpose—our  free  common  schools;  and  that  to  perfect  the  system  of  education  the  higher  institutions  of learning  are  also  indispensable,  all  tending  mutually  to  sustain  and  support  each  other;  that  all  are  of  public interest  and  concern,  and  to  be  cared  for  accordingly  by  appropriate  legislation.    On  this  subject  a  Board  of Education may be  regarded as a part of  the settled policy of  the State.    It has done much  to  further  the cause of education by arousing a more general interest on the subject, and otherwise. I  am  not  aware  that  any  further  general  legislation  is  necessary,  or  called  for,  in  connection  with  the operations  of  the  Board  of  Education;  if  so,  it will,  probably,  be  suggested  in  their  report,  to which  I  have  not had access, and will, without doubt, receive such consideration on your part as it deserves. Notwithstanding  the  commendable  liberality  exhibited  by  the  people  of  the  State  in  the  support  of  schools, in  my  view  we  are  deficient  in  one  of  the  best,  and  which,  ultimately,  might  be  made  one  of  the  most economical  agencies  of  education;  that  is,  public  town  libraries  accessible  to  all.    In  an  economical  view  an expenditure for such purpose  is not,  like most expenditures for educational purposes, consumed by  the use, and to  be  repeated  annually,  but  it  is  permanent  and  serviceable  for  a  succession  of  generations.    It  would  furnish means  of  intellectual  enjoyment  in  families,  and  thereby  make  home  more  attractive.    The  tendency  of  such well-selected  library  circulating  among  the  youth  of  the  town,  would  be  to  direct  the  tastes  and  habits  of  the young  to  substantial,  solid  and  useful  reading,  and  enable  them  to  treasure  up  knowledge  valuable  in  after  life.  It would  furnish a class of  reading consisting more of  fact  and  less of  fiction, and productive of a higher moral and  intellectual  culture  than much  of  the  reading  that  now  attracts  the  attention  of  the  young, which  dissipates rather  than  cultivates  and  improves  the  mind.    The  gradual  accumulation  of  such  library  in  a  town  would scarcely  be  felt  by  the  inhabitants,  except  by  its wholesome  influence  and  lasting  benefit,  to  the  old  as well  as the young.  I think it is to be regretted that towns do not avail themselves of the enabling act authorizing them to establish  such  libraries.    Whether  any  further  legislation  on  this  subject  is  advisable  at  this  time  I  submit  for your deliberate consideration. I  rejoice  to  see  that  the  interest  of  agriculture,  which  has  always  been  regarded  as  second  to  none  in  the State; an interest intimately identified with the prosperity of the State, and which must, at least for a long time to come,  be  the  business  and  employment  of  the  greater  portion  of  our  people,  is  enlisting  increased  interest  and attention, not only among our people, but on the part of the Legislature.  Our State is also rich in mineral wealth yet  to  be  developed,  and  in  water-power,  affording  abundant  facilities  for  manufacturing  purposes,  not  yet utilized.    These  interests  have  not  been,  and  should  not  be,  overlooked.    The  Board  of  Agriculture, Manufacturers and Mining, recently established by  the Legislature,  it  is hoped, will do much by  the application of  science  to  practical  experience,  and  by  other  means  to  promote  and  develop  these  important  industrial interests; and in this I trust the Board will be aided by all just and proper legislation. I  refer  you  to  the  report  of  the  Trustees  of  the  Reform  School,  and  to  the  report  of  the  Superintendent,  for the history and operations of the school for the past two years, and for information as to its present condition.  It is  evident  from  these  reports,  and  from  other  sources  of  information,  that  the  school  is  in  a  prosperous condition,  and  that  under  its  excellent  management,  it  is  fully  answering  the  purpose  of  its  creation  as  a reformatory  institution,  and  as  an  effective  agency  in  the  police  of  the  State.    It  is  stated  in  the  report  of  the trustees  that,  since  the  establishment  of  the  school,  several  boys  have  been  sent  there  convicted  of  minor,  and often  trifling  offenses,  that  are  so  feeble-minded  and  idiotic  as  to  be,  in  their  opinion,  incapable  of  committing crime,  and  incapable  of  receiving  benefit  by  continuing  there;  and  that,  as  the  trustees  have  no  power  to discharge, except for thorough reformation, and as there can be no reform where no capacity to do wrong exists, they  cannot  discharge  them.    They  ask  that  the  law  be  so  amended  as  to  give  the  Trustees  and  Superintendent the  power  to  discharge  in  such  cases.    I  submit whether  such  power  ought  to  be  granted,  except  in  connection with  some  other  suitable  provision  for  this  class  of  unfortunate  persons.    It  appears  that  the  Legislature,  at  its last  session,  authorized  the  Trustees  to  purchase  certain  property  named  in  the  act—a  lot  with  building  and machinery—in  their  discretion,  at  an  expense  not  exceeding  $15,000,  for  the  purpose  of  the  manufacture  of chairs;  that  before  any  purchase was made,  the  building  and machinery were  burned,  and  that  appropriation  of $15,000  remains  untouched  in  the  treasury.    As  to  the  question  whether  the  purpose  contemplated  in  the  act appropriating  that sum should still be carried out by  the purchase of certain other property of  like description,  I refer you to the report of the Trustees, and also to the report of the Superintendent made to them.  The propriety of  making  such  purchase  is  urged  by  the  Superintendent  upon  grounds  of  economy  and  profit  to  the  State,  by enabling  the  institution,  by  the  labor  of  the  boys,  the  inmates,  to  manufacture  chairs  entire,  instead  of  simply weaving in the cane; and also upon the ground of making the school more efficient in its reformatory character, by  teaching  the  inmates a  trade  that will  afford  them means of obtaining  employment  and gaining  a  livelihood, at the critical period of their lives when they leave the institution.   I am not sufficiently informed to warrant the expression of an opinion on  the  subject,  further  than  to  recommend  that  it  receive your consideration, and  such action as your wisdom shall dictate. The  biennial  reports  of  the  Directors  and  Superintendent  of  the  State  Prison,  as  to  its  condition  and management,  show  the  financial  affairs  of  the  prison  in  good  condition;  and  in  this  respect  there  seems  to  be  a great  improvement over  that of  former years.   At  the  last  session of  the Legislature, on  recommendation of  the officers of the prison, an act was passed directing the Directors to construct a chapel in one of the buildings, and make  such  alterations  and  repairs  of  the  old  prison  as  were  necessary  for  the  better  accommodation  of  the female  convicts  therein  confined;  and  for  these  purposes  they  were  authorized  to  appropriate  so  much  of  the surplus  earnings  of  the  prison  as  was  necessary,  not  exceeding  $2,000.    The  reports  show  that  the  chapel  has been constructed accordingly, and  that  the other  repairs have not been made, on account of  the  insufficiency of the  appropriation,  and  those  repairs  are  again  represented  as  being  much  needed  for  the  convenience  and comfort of  the  female prisoners confined  there.    I  recommend  that  the necessary appropriation be made  for  that purpose.    I  call  your  attention  to  the  remarks  of  the Directors  in  their  report,  in  relation  to  “the  impropriety  of sentencing  culprits  for  short  terms  on  small  offenses  to  such  an  institution  as  this.    The  main  purpose  of punishment  is  to  prevent  crime  and  reform  the  criminal.    In  order  to  accomplish  this  purpose,  criminal  laws must  be  punitory,  but  at  the  same  time  they  ought  to  be  reformatory  as  far  as  practicable.    There  are  minor offenses for which  the punishment prescribed is in the alternative, − fine, or  imprisonment in  the county  jail, or in the State Prison, in the discretion of the court, depending on the circumstances of the particular case.  In some of these cases, the milder punishment of fine or imprisonment in a county jail, proper for the purpose, would be sufficient, and answer all  the purposes of punishment, and be much more  likely  to  reform  the offender  than  the fixing on him the infamy that attaches to a State Prison convict. But  our  jails  are  places  of  detention  of  criminals  of  all  grades  and  classes  awaiting  trial,  and  usually affording no means of separation of prisoners; the most abandoned and hardened criminals being turned in with those  whose  offense  is  of  the  lowest  grade  −  committed,  perhaps,  more  from  weakness  than  depravity  −  thus exposing  the  latter  to  the depraving  influences of such associations.   Such  is generally  the condition of our  jails that  a  sentence  to  imprisonment  in  them  is,  practically,  a  sentence  to  idleness  in  a  school  of  vice.    If  a  fine  is imposed,  the consequence  is often,  from  the poverty of  the offender,  the  same, as  it  results  in  imprisonment  till released by pardon.   This same mischief also extends  to cases of offenders  imprisoned  in  the county  jail for  the most  trifling  offenses.    Our  jails  are  defective  as  a  place  of  punishment,  in  not  affording  any  means  of employment  to  the  prisoners.    The  very  idleness  to  which  they  are  condemned  tends  to  vice  and  crime,  while labor would be reformatory in its influence.  It probably would not be practicable, at least not within the limit of reasonable  expense,  to  convert  all  our  county  jails  into  work-houses,  but  they  should  be  so  constructed  as  to prevent the indiscriminate intercourse of prisoners and criminals of every grade. But  I have  long been of  the opinion  that  a work-house,  to which prisoners  from different parts of  the State, convicted  of  certain  minor  offences  might,  under  a  limited  discretion  in  courts  of  justice  as  to  the  place  of punishment,  be  sentenced,  would  be  of  public  benefit,  and  supply  an  existing  defect  in  the  means  of  the suppression of crime and  the punishment and reform of criminals.   Possibly  the conversion of some one county jail into such work-house might subserve this purpose.  I think the subject is worthy of your consideration. The  other  biennial  reports, which  I  have  not  had  the  opportunity  of  examining, will  be  before  you  for  your consideration.  I  trust  that  in  the  performance  of  the  various  duties  devolving  on  you,  both  in  investigating  the  past  and providing for the future, that true public economy will be observed, which neither transcends, nor fails to supply the  legitimate  necessities  of  the  State,  and which will  limit  the  session  to  the  time  necessary  to  do  deliberately and well what the public good requires to be done.    EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, MONTPELIER, Oct. 8, 1874.                         ASAHEL PECK. }
