Inaugural address of  Frederick Holbrook  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  Annual Session  1862  Tuesday, October 10, 1862 Inaugural Address   Gentlemen of the Senate  and House of Representatives: –  In  the  present  august  and  momentous  crisis  in  the  affairs  of  our  country,  the  strength,  the  wisdom,  and forecast  of man  are  wholly  inadequate  to  save  us  and  our  institutions;  and  how  fitting,  therefore,  that  we  seek direction  from  the  eternal Mind,  the  source  of  all  power  and  knowledge,  imploring  His  counsels  to  enlighten, and  His  providence  to  guide  us.    Let  us  remember  that  while  the  Almighty  may  permit  the  spirit  of  discord suddenly  to  enter  and  scourge  a  whole  nation  with  cruel  war,  it  is  He,  also,  who,  after  correcting  a  people, restores their wasted land, bringing peace and prosperity out of war and devastation. Viewing the condition of Vermont during the past sad year, we perceive that we have occasion for profound gratitude  to  Almighty  God,  for  preserving  us  from  the  blight  of  war  within  our  own  territory,  for  the  general prevalence of health,  the bountiful harvests,  and  the prosperity of our  industrial  interests,  for  the  absence of  all tendencies  to  disorder  in  the  popular  mind,  and  for  that  prevalent  spirit  of  patriotism  and  self-sacrifice  which has  so  universally  characterized  our  people,  and  led  them  cheerfully  to  bear  every  burden  which  it  has  been necessary for them to assume, on behalf of their country and the rights of mankind. It  is  gratifying  to  realize  that  at  each  and  every  call  of  our  country,  in  her  hour  of  peril,  thousands  of  the young men  of  our  State  have willingly  and  eagerly  seized  arms  and  have  gone,  or  are  going  forth  to  battle  for the Union, and to drive back the surges of rebellion.  Their valor on every field, and in every situation in which they have been placed, rivals that of the early heroes of Vermont, justifies their noble origin, and proves that the race has not degenerated, but  is now, as of old, capable of  the most heroic and manly deeds, and may be  relied upon  in  every  emergency.   Any  language  I  can  employ  is  too  feeble  to  speak  their  praise; but  I may  say  that  it has been demonstrated, and  is  in high quarters admitted,  that, for steadiness, reliability, courage and endurance, the Vermont troops are not excelled by those of any other state or country. We  should  gratefully  remember  the  patriotic  devotion  manifested  by  those  who,  unable  to  bear  arms  and endure  the hardships and  fatigues of  the  soldier, have nobly aided and encouraged others  to do  so, contributing liberally  of  their means  to  provide  for  the  brave  volunteers.    The  lasting  thanks  of  every  patriot  are  due  to  the women  of  Vermont,  for  their  devotion  to  country  in  so  freely  giving  up  their  husbands,  brothers  and  sons,  for the  struggle,  and  their  sympathy  and  zeal  in  furnishing,  in  such  variety  and  abundance,  the  articles  of  their handiwork, and  the delicacies  indispensable  to  the comfort of camps and hospitals, and  to  the alleviation of  the sufferings of sick and wounded soldiers, lonely, and far from kindred and home. Thus will  it  ever  be with Vermont  to  the  end  of  the war;  she will  never  falter  nor  look  back,  but will  press forward,  until,  if  need  be,  her  last  dollar  is  expended,  and  her  last  son  falls,  upholding  in  his  dying  grasp  “the flag of our Union,” and with his latest breath ejaculating a benediction upon his country. Of  the  many  questions  of  public  interest  which  required  the  attention  of  the  Legislature,  none  are  more important,  in  the  present  crisis,  than  those  relating  to  the  finances  of  the  State.    I  refer  you,  gentlemen,  to  the Report  of  the  State  Treasurer,  for  the  full  details  of  the  financial  transactions  of  the  past  year,  and  of  the standing  of  the  State  Finances  Generally.    From  this  Report,  I  gather  the  material  to  make  the  following statement: The receipts for the fiscal year ending Sept. 1, 1862, have been as follows: $36, 517, 30  Balance in Treasury, Sept. 1, 1861, Received on State bonds of 1861, issued since Sept. 1, 1861,  401,00,00 538,022,44  Received on State tax, 2,887,52 Received on tax on Foreign Bank Stock,  Received from sundry State and County officers, Judges of Probate, &c., 21,445,48  57,277, 94 57,203,83 104,623,41  Balances remaining in Treasury, due for allotments and credits  of officers and soldiers in service, Received of J.W. Stewart, Financial agent, from the U.S. Treasury, in part payment for advances by the State in raising and  $123,000,00 furnishing troops for the service, Received of Military Claims Commissioners, from U.S. Treasury, in part payment for  said advances, 152,000,00  -----  275,000,00 Credits from all other sources  110,359,03   ------------------- Making in all the sum of  $1,442,509,71 The disbursements for the fiscal year ending Sept. 1, 1862, have been as follows:  $273,306,81  For Military expenses incurred by my predecessor, Debentures, General Assembly and Council of Censors,  29,723,90 32,737,49  Salaries, State officers, Judges Probate, State’s Attorneys, 103,262,70  Court and Auditor’s orders, State pay of $7 per month, to soldiers in service,  446,955,29 ON ORDERS OF PRESENT EXECUTIVE, VIZ: For Recruiting, Equipment, &c., of new Regiments,  and various supplies for old Regiments, such as  Rubber Blankets, Tents, Medical aid, &c., State pay of $7 per month to soldiers from date of  Enlistment to muster, Claims allowed by commissioner, on Claims  ----      186,874,11 25,045,87 Outstanding 16,339,38  Aid to Families of soldiers, 34,529,54  U.S. Surplus Fund, sundry Towns, 56,230,28  Payment of Interest on various Loans, 15,000,00  Payment of Loan of 1860, 1,232,50  Payment to Agricultural Societies, 3,211,44  Board of Education, 7,984,79  Special appropriations of Legislature,  8,000,00 Hiram Harlow, in State Bonds,                       2,871,07 Sundry purposes,  --------------------  $1,218,259,30  Making in all the sum of --------------------    $224,250,41 Balance in Treasury, The  Treasurer  informs  me  that  “a  large  portion  of  this  balance  stands  to  the  credit  of  the  State,  (say $175,000,00)  in  the  forty-one Banks  in  the State,  and  the Suffolk Bank, Boston,  -  the  remainder  being  cash  on hand; and that a considerable portion of this balance will be drawn for by the opening of the Legislature.” The  action  of  the  Legislature  of  last  year,  in  providing  for  the  payment  of  the  extraordinary  expenses incurred for war purposes partly by direct  taxation and partly by  issuing State Bonds appears  to have been wise in principle.  It would seem desirable, to place a considerable portion of the appropriations necessary to be made for war expenses,  in  the  form of a  funded debt.   The people  should not now be overburdened with  taxation, as, in  many  way,  they  have  large  sacrifices  to  make  for  the  support  of  the  Government  and  the  defence  of  the Country; and our present sacrifices being even more for posterity than for ourselves, we cannot doubt that those who come after us will be able and willing to share with us the pecuniary burdens now involved.      25,091,37 $51,767,17 $186,874,14  The whole amount of military expenditures for which orders have  been drawn on the State Treasurer, by the present Executive,  up to Sept. 1, 1862, as stated by the Treasurer, is. Since that date, and prior to Oct. 1, 1862, orders have been drawn  5,114,00  for additional military expenses amounting to ---------------   Making in all the sum of $191,988,14  This amount is composed, in general terms, of the following classes of payments: 1,  State pay to soldiers of $7 per month from date of enlistment   to date of muster into the United States service; also pay of    Officers from date of commission to date of muster, and   expenses of paying, State pay due Second Regiment, as certified by Commissioners   of Claims, 2,  Claims allowed by Commissioners to settle outstanding    Claims. 3,  Equipment, Medical aid, and stores, furnished to the various   Regiments now in service, the amount expended for which  has already been presented to the General Government and allowed,  Equipment of 5th Regiment, presented by Commissioners,  4,  Equipment of Regiments quite recently raised, and expenses of recruiting and drilling all the troops raised the past official   year, the amount for which has not yet been presented to the    Government for allowance, but which is supposed to be collectable, 5,  And there remains a balance, perhaps mostly uncollectible, to  be considered in the light of State expenses, which is included   principally under the head of sundries, in the abstract   8,026,48   accompanying this Communication, of ---------------    Making in all the sum of $191,988,14    An  Abstract,  stating  the  above  expenditures  in  some  detail  may  be  found  in  the  appendix  to  this Communication, to which reference is respectfully made. The  advances  mentioned  under  the  fourth  classification  above,  would  ere  this  date  have  been  presented  in proper  form,  to  the  General  Government,  for  adjustment  and  allowance,  but  for  the  many  pressing  official duties, growing out of the raising of troops in answer to the call of Government, which have occupied my time.  It will    afford me  pleasure,  at  any  time,  to  answer  such  questions  as  individual Senators  or Representatives may desire  to  ask, whether  in  relation  to matters  spoken of  in  this Communication, or pertaining  in any way  to State  affairs;  and  as  it  is  certainly  desirable  that  the General Assembly  should  fully  understand  how  the  public moneys  have  been  expended,  I  shall  be  pleased  to  exhibit,  to  any  Committee  appointed  for  the  purpose,  the requisite accounts and vouchers readily and clearly to explain such expenditures. The  condition  of  the  State  Finances,  Sept.  1st,  1862,  as  appears  from  the  report  of  the  Treasurer,  is  as follows: 71,802,74 813,75 6,177,20 28,309,43 Due Banks, for contributions to the Safety Fund Due County Treasurers, tax on Non-Residents’ Stock, Balance due for U.S. Surplus Money, Balances estimated due to Soldiers for State pay of $7 per month, Loans of 1859, due Nov. 21, 1864, LIABILITIES      $13,125,00 2,887,52 7,686,61 200,000,00 75,000,00 Loan of April 1861, Bonds issued payable ten years from June 1, 1860,  Loan of 1861, due Oct. 1, 1862,  Loan of 1861, due Dec.1, 1862, Loan of 1861, due Jan. 1, 1863,  Balance in Treasury, due for allotments of soldiers,   751,000,00 20,000,00 3,000,00 35,000,00 57,277,94 RESOURCES. $725,720,00 $689,396,76 $275,000,00 $224,250,41 43,204,82 1,995,12 48,428,76 Balance in, and due the Treasury, on demand, Due on Tax payable June 1st and Oct. 15th, 1862, Due from Poultney,       “       H.M. Bates. Amount of the bills of the State, against the    U.S., for War Expenditures,  Of which the General Government has    Refunded 40 per cent, or And has offset the State tax due the U.S. in  June, 1862, less 15 per cent, 179,000,00 Both sums amounting to 454,407,80 Which subtracted form the whole amount above, leaves a balance still due the State, from the United states, of  234,988,96   It will be readily seen from the above statement, that the indebtedness of the State, in excess of its resources, is funded in State Bonds, payable in ten years from June 1, 1860. The expenses of  the current year cannot be accurately given; but  so  far as  is now known,  some of  the more important unavoidable disbursements may be approximately estimated as follows: The  three  years’  troops  now  in  service  form  Vermont,  compose  ten  Regiments  of  Infantry,  and  one 11,000 men Regiment of Cavalry, which, at the maximum, would number in all about  250   “   .    Two Batteries of Artillery, about 125 men each,  270   “   .  Three Companies of Sharp-Shooters, about 90 men each,    --------------- Making in all, 11,520 men  But as considerable deduction should be made for missing men, by reason of the various casualties of the service, supposed that one quarter of the above number, or 2880 men, are deducted; we then have 8640 men, who will be entitled to receive, each, the State pay of $7 per month, which for twelve months, should they continue in service for that period, will amount to.  The rank and file of the five Regiments of Militia, recently raised, amounts to about 4700 men.  Deducting one-eight of this number, for the diminution which may result from casualties of the service, and we have 4113 men, who, should the Legislature so decide, will be entitled to receive each $7 per month from the State, which, for their allotted period of   service, or nine months, will amount to Ordinary State expenses, about Payment of Loan of 1857, due Nov. 1, 1862,   Making the approximate estimate of  259,119,00 250,000,00 100,00,00 ---------------- $1,334,839,00          It  may  be  necessary,  during  the  current  year,  to  raise  more  troops  in  the  State,  which  would,  of  course, increase current expenses.  There may be another tax levied on the State, by the United States; but probably the balance of $234,988,96, still due from the United States, will more than offset any tax thus levied. I  respectfully  recommend  that suitable provision be made during  the present session  for  the expenses of  the current year. About  the  20th  of November,  1861,  recruiting  agencies were  established  for  raising  the Seventh  and Eighth Regiments of Infantry, and the First and Second Batteries of Artillery.  These fine Regiments and Batteries went into camp early in January following, – the Seventh Regiment at Rutland, the Eighth Regiment and First Battery at  Brattleboro,  and  the  Second  Battery  at  Lowell, Mass.    The  entire  outfit  of  the  Seventh  Regiment,  excepting arms  and  accoutrements,  was  provided  by  the  Quartermaster  General  of  the  State.    The  outfit  of  the  Eighth Regiment,  and  of  the  first  and  Second  Batteries  of  Artillery,  was,  with  a  few  exceptions,  furnished  by  the General  Government  through  the  Department  of  New  England.    These  Regiments  together  with  the  First Battery,  left  the  State  early  in March  last,  for  Ship  Island, Miss.,  to  serve  in  the  Department  of  the  Gulf.    The Second Battery left Lowell, Mass., for the same destination, in February last. In the latter part of October, 1861, the third Company of Sharp Shooters, commanded by Capt. Gilbert Hart, was organized, and early in January following, was sent to Washington. Also,  in  the month  of December,  1861,  the First Regiment  of Vermont Cavalry,  raised  and  commanded  by Col. Lemuel B. Platt, received marching orders, and left camp in Burlington, proceeding to Washington.  During  the months of February and March  last, four hundred and  twelve men were  recruited in  the State,  to fill  the  thinned  ranks  of  the  Second,  Third,  Fourth,  Fifth  and  Sixth  regiments  of  Infantry.    Early  in  April  they were  mustered  into  service,  at  Burlington,  and,  on  the  21st  of  that  month,  sent  to  their  respective  Regiments, then at Yorktown, Va. In  compliance  with  a  request  received  by  me  from  the  Secretary  of  War,  the  following  statement  was forwarded to him by the Adjutant General, showing the number of three years troops furnished by the State, and in the service of the United States, on the 16th of April, 1862: 2nd Regiment Infantry, Col. Henry Whiting, 3d        “               “          “   B.N. Hyde, 4th        “               “          “    E.H. Stoughton, 5th        “               “          “    H.A.

On  the 21st of May  last,  the Secretary of War  called on Vermont  for one Regiment of  Infantry,  to be  raised immediately,  accompanied  by  a  request  to  raise  as  many  Regiments  thereafter  as  possible,  within  a  certain specified  time.    Under  this  call  the  Ninth  Regiment  of  Infantry  was  raised,  and  was  ordered  into  camp  at Brattleboro; but before it was fully organized, and about the 1st of July last, the call was issued by the President of the United States for three hundred thousand three years troops and the call of the Secretary of War, made  in May,  for  fifty  thousand  three  years  men,  under  which  the  raising  of  the  Ninth  Regiment  commenced,  was merged  in  the  larger number  required  by  the President.   The Ninth Regiment  left  camp,  for Washington  on  the 15th  of  July,  and  was  the  first  Regiment  furnished  by  any  State  under  the  calls,  first,  for  fifty  thousand,  and second, for three hundred thousand three years troops. 1046 men. 1032   “  . 1100   “  . 1018   “  . 1004   “  . 1014   “  . 1015   “  . ------------------ 7229 men. 965   “   .      “   .   Early  in  July  last,  recruiting  agents  were  appointed  for  raising  the  Tenth  and  Eleventh  Regiments  of Infantry.    The  State  was  divided  into  twenty  districts,  a  principal  recruiting  officer  appointed  in  each,  with directions  to  raise  a  full  company  of  men,  which  in  nearly  every  district  was  accomplished.    These  two Regiments went  into camp at Brattleboro, between  the 10th and 16th of August.   The Tenth Regiment  left camp for Washington on the 6th, and the Eleventh Regiment on the 7th, of September last. Twelve hundred three years’ men, for the old Regiments, were also recruited, mostly in the month of August last, and were sent to fill companies in those Regiments more or less diminished by the casualties of the service.  These men were  ordered  to  Burlington  for muster  and  to  receive  their  advance  pay  and  bounty,  and  each man was  allowed  to  designate  the  company  and  Regiment  in  which  he  would  prefer  to  serve.    The  men  have  been sent  forward  from Burlington  to  their  respective Regiments,  in  detachments  of  from  two  to  three  hundred men each. The quota of Vermont, under the call for three hundred thousand three years men, was made up as follows: In the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Regiments there were about  3000 men 1200   “  . For filling old Regiments there were  3773 men Raised under call for 500,000 men,  3100   “  . Quota due under do.               do. Which subtracted from the number --------------- 673   “  .  Actually raised, leaves an excess to be credited of --------------  These, added to the numbers actually raised under the call 4873  “  .  for 300,000 three years’ men, make  On the 4th of August last, a call was issued by order of the President of the United States, for a draft of three hundred  thousand  Militia,  accompanied  by  orders  specifying  the  time,  and  directing  the  mode,  of  the  draft.  Immediately  on  receiving  this  call,  an  Order  was  issued  by  the  State  authorities  of  Vermont,  calling  out  the organized  companies of Militia  in  the State,  to  serve  for  the  period  of  nine months  in  the  service  of  the United States, directing them to fill their ranks to the legal standard, and authorizing them to receive into their ranks the quotas of  adjacent  towns  till  the  companies  should  reach  the maximum of one hundred  and one men  each.   An Order  was  also  issued  for  a  new  enrollment  of  the  Militia  of  the  State,  preparatory  to  a  draft  on  the  1st  of September, should a draft become necessary; and this Order was accompanied by a proposition to the people of Vermont,  that,  if  they  should  so  elect,  they  might  furnish  the  quota  of  the  State,  –  forty-eight  hundred  and ninety-eight  men,  –  by  voluntary  action,  –  town  officers  and  patriotic  citizens  raising  the  quotas  of  their respective  towns,  in  their  own  way,  and  adjacent  towns  combining  their  several  quotas  in  companies  of  one hundred and one men each, which companies, on being  tendered  to  the State authorities,  in  lieu of drafted men, would be accepted as such, provided a proper Roll accompanied  the  tender, giving  the names and residences of the  men,  and  binding  them  by  a  suitable  contract  to  serve  for  the  period  of  nine  months,  in  lieu  of  drafted militia,  receiving  the  pay  of militia,  and  subject  to  the  rules  and  regulations  governing militia  in  the  service  of the United  States.   Knowing  that  the  people  of Vermont  are  proverbial  for  the  prompt,  thrifty,  economical  and efficient management of their affairs, I thought it proper to make them such a proposition, leaving them to raise the  requisite  number  of  men  wholly  in  their  own  way,  not  doubting  that  the  business  would  be  accomplished with  system,  order  and  decorum.    It  is  well  known  how  promptly  they  accepted  the  proposition,  and  that  fifty companies,  or  five Regiments,  of  nine months  volunteers,  in  lieu  of  drafted militia, were  raised  in  about  thirty days; and that, too, after our State, with a population of about three hundred and fifteen thousand, had furnished about  thirteen  thousand  three  years  troops  for  the war.    This  result  is  a  remarkable  demonstration  of  the  unity, patriotic  enthusiasm,  indomitable  and  unconquerable  spirit  of  a  free  people,  when  their  Country  is  imperiled, and  calls  for  their  services  in  its  defence;  and  the  record  of  their  action  in  this  case, will  be  to  their  honor  and credit so long as the page of history endures. It  is  true  that  many  perplexities  had  to  be  encountered,  and  difficulties  surmounted,  growing  out  of  the imperfect  returns  on which  the  acting  both  of  the  State  authorities  and  the  people  necessarily  had  to  be  based, inasmuch  as  there  positively  was  not  time  to  make  thorough  corrections  of  either  former  or  recent  returns  on which  the  action  both  of  the  State  authorities  and  the  people  necessarily  had  to  be  based,  inasmuch  as  there positively  was  not  time  to  make  thorough  corrections  of  either  former  or  recent  returns.    The  report  of  the Adjutant  and  Inspector  General  will  dwell  more  fully  on  these  perplexities  and  difficulties.    But  the  general result  is  so  creditable  to  the  State,  that  we  may  all  with  candor  and  good  feeling  review  the  ground,  and  be satisfied with that result, - the very difficulties experienced heightening its value and effect. About  twelve  thousand  troops have been  raised  in  the State, since October, 1861.   The details of  recruiting, organizing,  subsisting,  clothing,  arming,  equipping,  paying  and  transporting  them,  have  been  numerous,  and productive of many cares, responsibilities, perplexities and embarrassments. Considerable delay has been experienced  in getting  the Regiments of nine months men  into camp, owing  to the  inability  of  the  General  Government  to  furnish  the  requisite  clothing,  arms,  and  camp  equipage  with dispatch,  from  the  fact  that  so  large  a  number  of  fresh  troops  had  suddenly  been  called  into  service.  Requisitions were early made on  the Quartermaster General of  the army  for clothing, arms, accoutrements, and camp and garrison equipage; but  in place of clothing,  the materials  therefor were sent forward, with  the request that the Quartermaster General of the State should contract for the making of the clothing in the State, for which certain specified prices would be paid by the General Government.  The tents ordered could not be supplied and therefore  the  General  Government  directed  barracks  to  be  erected,  and  sent  an  agent  into  the  State  who contracted with certain parties  to build  them, agreeably  to specifications  furnished by him.   The original design of having  the  five Regiments  remain  awhile  together  in  camp  in  the State, was modified by  subsequent  events, and  the  State  authorities  were  requsted  to  send  them  forward,  a  Regiment  at  a  time,  at  the  earliest  practicable moment.   Accordingly, one Regiment has been  forwarded, and  the  remaining  four will be sent as expeditiously as they can be prepared for marching orders. The  rank  and  file  of  the  Twelfth  Regiment,  which  is  composed  of  companies  of  the  “Uniformed  Militia,” are,  by  an  Act  entitled  “an  Act  providing  pay  for  the  Uniformed  Militia,”    approved  April  26,  1861,  clearly entitled  to  the  State  pay  of  seven  dollars  per  month,  in  addition  to  their  United  States  pay,  while  “in  active service.”   But  as  there  is,  perhaps,  room  for  doubt, whether  the  soldiers  of  the  other  four Regiments  of Militia are,  or  are  not,  entitled  to  seven  dollars  per  month  from  the  State,  in  addition  to  the  United  States  pay,  I respectfully  suggest  that  the  doubt  should  be  immediately  and  clearly  solved  by  some  definite  action  of  the Legislature.   Perhaps  the Act  entitled  “An Act  providing  pay  for  certain  soldiers,  and  in  relation  to  the  support of  families  of  Volunteers,”  approved  Nov.  20,  1861,  does  secure  the  payment  of  seven  dollars  per  month  to these troops; but it would be well for the Legislature to make some specific declaration in this regard. In  accordance with  the  directions  of  an Act  entitled  “An Act  to  appoint Commissioners  to  adjust  and  settle certain  outstanding  claims  for  expenditures  for  military  purposes,”  approved  Nov.  20,  1861,  and  of  an  Act entitled  “An Act  providing  for  the  immediate  settlement  and  allowance  of  claims  in  favor  of  this  State  against the  United  States,”  approved  Nov.  21,  1861,  I  appointed  Hon.  F.E. Woodbridge,  Hon.  Geo.  F.  Edmunds,  and Col. George A. Merrill, a Board of Commissioners, with instructions to carry out the purposes contemplated by these two Acts.  Early in December last, the Commissioners gave notice of times and places for the presentation and  adjustment  of  such  claims.    For  each  claim  allowed,  the  Commissioners  gave  a  certificate  indicating  the amount  thereof, and  to whom payable;  for which, on presentation, an order was drawn by me, on  the Treasurer of the State, in favor of such claimant.  The aggregate amount of the claims so allowed was $25,091,37. The  Commissioners  also  made  up  the  account  of  moneys  expended  by  my  predecessor,  in  raising, organizing,  subsisting,  clothing,  arming,  equipping  and  transporting  troops  for  service  under  the United States, providing  and  arranging  all necessary vouchers  therefor,  and  causing  such vouchers  to be  recorded  at  length  in books  prepared  for  that  purpose,  which  were  afterwards  lodged  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary  of  State.    The Commissioners  subsequently  proceeded  to  Washington,  and  presented  the  account  and  vouchers  to  the Department of the Treasury, for adjustment and allowance. In October, 1861, I appointed a Board of Medical Examiners for the examination of candidates for the office of Surgeons of Regiments, consisting of Samuel W. Thayer, Jr., M.D., Edward E. Phelps, M.D., and Charles L. Allen, M.D., who have attended faithfully to the duties of their appointment. Agreeably  to  an  Act  entitled  “An  Act  in  relation  to  Supplies  of  Volunteers,”  approved  Nov.  21,  1861, directing  the Governor,  under  certain  conditions,  to  supply  the  volunteers  from  this  State,  in  the  service  of  the United  States,  from  time  to  time,  as  their  circumstances  require,  with  clothing,  tents,  camp  equipage,  arms, equipments,  provisions,  medicines,  and  all  articles  required  in  the  medical  department,”  I  authorized  the Quartermaster  General  to  furnish  rubber  blankets,  whenever  needed  by  our  troops,  new  tents  for  the  Third Regiment,  which  were  much  needed,  and  medicines  and  medical  stores  for  the  Vermont  Brigade,  which  was suffering from sickness  in camp near  the Potomac. A statement of  the expenses of  these supplies appears  in  the appendix to this communication. I also appointed Edward E. Phelps, M.D., State Medical Commissioner to visit the Vermont Brigade, during the  late  autumn  and  early  winter,  when  so  much  sickness  prevailed  therein,  and  advise  with  the  Regimental Surgeons  as  to  the  treatment  of  the  prevailing  maladies,  and  report  to  me  what  further  should  be  done  to alleviate  the  suffering,  and  promote  the  health,  of  the  troops.    At  his  suggestion,  medical  supplies  were purchased and forwarded by the Quartermaster General, and three additional assistant Surgeons were sent to the Brigade,  for  three months’  service,  to  aid  the  over  tasked  Regimental  Surgeons.    Dr.  Phelps  was  subsequently appointed,  by  the War Department,  Surgeon  of  the Vermont Brigade.    It  is  believed  that much  benefit  resulted to  our  troops  from  these  provisions  for  their  relief.    The  expenses  incurred  will  be  presented  to  the  General Government for payment. In October  last,  agreeably  to  a  Joint Resolution  of  the Legislature,  I  appointed Hon.  Joseph  Poland  Special Agent,  to  visit  the  camps  of  the Vermont Regiments  on  the  Potomac,  to  receive  such  portions  of  the wages  of the  troops,  recently  paid  them  by  Government,  as  they  might  desire  to  transmit  to  their  families  in  Vermont.  The expenses of  this agency appear  in  the  financial statements appended  to  this Communication.   The duties of the agency were faithfully performed. Afterwards, and in compliance with the purposes contemplated in Section 3, of the Act entitled “An Act for the  aid  of  the  Vermont  Volunteers  in  transmitting  portions  of  their  pay  to  their  families  and  assignees,” approved  Nov.  20,  1861,  I  appointed  Messrs.  John  B.  Page  and  John  Howe,  Jr.,  Commissioners  to  visit  the camps  of  the  Vermont  troops  and  explain  the  allotment  system  to  them,  and  induce  them  to  allot  a  portion  of their  pay  to  their  families  or  agents  in  Vermont.    Soon  after  the  arrival  of  these  Commissioners  in  camp,  the President  of  the  United  State,  by  a  then  recent  provision  of  Congress,  appointed  them,  together  with  Hon. Joseph Poland, Commissioners,  to perform  the duties contemplated  in  the previous appointment by me.   But as Messrs.  Page  and  Howe  had  incurred  expenses  under  their  appointment  by me,  I  deemed  it  just  and  proper  to refund to them their expenses. In December last, Col. Frank E. Howe, of the City of New York, was appointed and commissioned Military agent of Vermont in that City.  He has well performed the duties of his agency.  His services have been literally indispensable  to  the  State,  in many ways.   On  accepting  his  commission  from  the  State,  he  prescribed  that  his services were to be gratuitously rendered; but so many calls have been made upon him, especially in ministering to our  sick  and wounded men,  and  in  furnishing  from  time  to  time  a  complete  record of  the names,  residences, condition,  &c.,  of  our  soldiers  in  the  New  York  Hospitals,  that  I  respectfully  recommend  that  he  be  liberally rewarded by the State.  Finding that many of our sick and wounded soldiers were being sent by Government to the Hospitals in and near  Philadelphia,  I  recently  appointed  Mr.  Robert  R.  Corson,  of  that  City,  Military  agent  of  Vermont,  to exercise  a  friendly  care  for  such  Vermont  soldiers  as  might  be  there  placed.    Mr.  Corson  is  a  kind-hearted, philanthropic  gentleman, who  delights  in  thus  contributing  to  the  necessities  of  the  great  cause  of  the Country, and  does  not  claim  anything  like  a  compensation  for  his  labors,  being  content  with  the  bare  reimbursement  of actual expenses incurred. Almost  immediately  upon  assuming  the Executive office,  I perceived  that  it would be  impossible  for me  to discharge  the  duties  in  detail  imposing  upon  the  Governor  by  an  Act  entitled  “An  Act    to  provide  for  the families  of  citizens  of  Vermont  mustered  into  the  service  of  the  United  States,”  approved  April  26,  1861.    I accordingly  appointed Mr.  John Howe,  Jr.,  of Brandon,  agent  to  perform  the  services  required  by  that  law,  his acts  to  be  subject  to  direction  and  approval  by  me.    I  believe  Mr.  Howe  has  discharged  the  duties  of  his appointment  admirably,  reducing  the  business  of  that  agency  to  a  just  and wise  system.    I  have  the  pleasure  of calling your attention to his lucid and valuable Report, herewith transmitted.  Some further legislation to perfect the  objects  contemplated  by  the  act  referred  to,  seems  to  be  quite  desirable,  and  is  indicated  in  Mr.  Howe’s Report.  I respectfully ask your attention to the subject. During  the past year,  the demands upon  the Adjutant  and  Inspector General  and  the Quartermaster General have been such as to require the devotion of nearly their entire time to the service of the State.  It is certainly my duty,  as  it  is my  pleasure,  to  bear  testimony  to  the  ability  and  faithfulness with which  they have performed  the responsible  and  arduous  duties  of  their  respective  offices.    As  the  salaries  allowed  by  statute  to  these  officers, based  on  their  ordinary  duties  in  times  of  peace,  afford  no  adequate  compensation  for  the  extraordinary  labors now demanded of them, I respectfully suggest that they be compensated for the services they have rendered. Full  and  clear  Reports  by  these  officers,  of  the  transactions  in  their  respective  departments  during  the  past official  year,  would  have  been  ready  for  transmission  to  the  Legislature  at  the  opening  of  the  present  session, but  for  the very onerous duties which have  recently engaged,  and do  still demand,  their whole  attention.   Their Reports, however, will soon be laid before you. It  is proper  for me  to say  that  the State  is  indebted  to  the Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs  for  faithful and  indefatigable  attention  to  the  important  duties  of  his  office.    He  has  devoted  his  time  to  those  duties,  and should  be  suitably  compensated  therefor.    I  may  remark  further,  that  I  am  under  many  obligations  to  the gentlemen of my staff, for their assistance in the transaction of the business of the Executive Department. Agreeably  to  an Act  entitled  “An Act  for  the  better  protection  of  the  Treasury,”  I  appointed Hon.  John W. Stewart, of Middlebury,  Inspector of Finance; but owing  to other  engagements he  felt  compelled  to decline  the appointment, and Charles W. Bradbury, Esq., of Vergennes, was appointed to that office and has attended to its duties. At the session of the General assembly in 1860, the Hon. Milo L. Bennett, the Hon. Pierpoint Isham and the Hon. Andrew Tracy were  appointed  a Board  of Commisssioners    to  “revise,  re-draft,  compile,  consolidate  and arrange  the public statutes of  this State, on  the basis, plan, and general form and method of  the revised statutes, with  authority  to  omit  redundant  enactments,  reject  superfluous words,  circuitous  and  ambiguous  phraseology, recommend  amendments,  and  to  condense  the  whole  into  as  concise  and  comprehensive  form  as  is  consistent with a full and clear expression of the Legislature, and report the same to the General Assembly”; and the act of 1860 was  so  far  amended  by  the  act  of  1861  as  to  require  the  Report  of  the  Commissioners  to  be made  to  the Governor.   Accordingly  the Chairman  of  the Board  has  transmitted  to me  a  copy  of  the  revision,  prepared  and printed  for  the  use  of  the  General  Assembly,  accompanied  with  a  written  Report  explanatory  of  the  course pursued in making the revision, which will be submitted to you at an early day. Under  the  Act  of  Congress  of  May  23,  1850,  this  State  was  entitled  to  two  Members  in  the  House  of Representatives of  the Thirty-Eighth Congress.   On  the 26th of March  last I received a communication from  the Department  of  the  Interior  informing  me  that  “a  Law  was  enacted  on  the  4th  of  March,  1862,  increasing  the number  of  Representatives  for  certain  States,  including  the  State  of  Vermont,  whereby  that  State  is  entitled  to three Representatives in the Thirty-Eighth and subsequent Congresses.” Our  recent  experience  in  endeavoring  to  raise  troops  under  the  present  militia  laws  of  this  State,  proves beyond a doubt  the  immediate need of some  important changes  in  those  laws.   Perhaps  that complete and well-proportioned militia  system which  shall embody  the permanent policy of  the State, will be  the work of a  future time,  when  we  can  avail  ourselves  of  the  experience  and  suggestions  of  many  able  officers  now  in  active service.    But  at  least  the  present  laws  should  be  so  far  amended  as  to  secure  a  perfect  enrollment  of  all  able-bodied  men,  liable  to  do  military  duty,  and  a  thorough  and  impartial  medical  inspection  of  all  enrolled  men.  And  to  this  end  competent  Medical  Boards  should  be  established  in  each  county,  –  no  Board,  however, performing  its  functions  in  the  county  in which  it  is  raised, but  in  some other  county,  remote  enough  to  ensure an impartial inspection. My  time  has  been  so  constantly  occupied  with  the  numerous  details  of  business  involved  in  the  military operations of  the State,  that  I have not been  able  to give  that attention  to our public  institutions  and benevolent and  educational  enterprises,  which  it  would  have  been  my  pleasure  to  bestow.    The  practical  workings  of  our educational  system  have  been  somewhat  observed,  and  I  am  induced  to  think  that  no  important  changes  are needed,  or  would,  at  the  present  time,  conduce  to  the  interests  of  education  in  Vermont.  I  have  a  high appreciation  of  the  value  of  the  services  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Board  of  Education,  and  believe  that  if  the operations  of  the  Board,  as  conducted  by  him,  are  allowed  to  proceed,  they  will  soon  ripen  into  a  permanent, well-proportioned system, finely adapted to our customs as a people, and our peculiar circumstances and wants. The Asylum for the Insane continues in its hitherto prosperous condition, dispensing healing balm to many a troubled  mind  or  affording  a  quiet,  well-ordered  retreat  to  minds  permanently  disordered.    The  Reports  of  the Trustees and Superintendent indicate the condition and progress of the Institution. The State Prison has been well managed.  It is the good fortune of the State to have in the Superintendent of the  Prison,  a  gentleman  of  acknowledged  humanity,  of  much  practical  sagacity  and  sound  judgment,  and  of decided  character.   The  bearing  and  influence  of  such  a  person  are  always  beneficial  and  especially  salutary  in the position occupied by the Superintendent of the Prison. The  Bank  Commissioner  appointed  at  the  last  session  of  the  Legislature  having  resigned  his  office,  I appointed Mr. Jerre E. Dickerman his successor, whose report upon the condition of the Banks of the State will be before you.  It appears from that report that these institutions have been well conducted during the past fiscal year. It  will  not  escape  your  attention  that  among  the  duties  that  devolve  upon  the  Legislature  at  the  present Session,  is  that of electing a person  to represent  this State  in  the Senate of  the United States,  for  the  term of six years from the 4th of March next, on which day the existing term of the Hon. Solomon Foot will expire. It  is an occasion  for  renewed congratulation  that  the people of Vermont have again shown  their devotion  to the  cause  of  the  Union  by  laying  aside  almost  unanimously,  all  considerations  of  a  partisan  character,  and uniting  in  earnest  support  of  the  National  Government  which  is  charged  with  the  high  duty  of  defending  and maintaining  that  sacred  cause.   The  position  of Vermont  in  this  great  life-struggle  of  the Nation  can  neither  be questioned  nor  misunderstood.    The  blood  of  her  sons  has  reddened  many  battle-fields,  and  their  valor  and endurance have vindicated her historical renown.  Her people admit no thought of concession to, or compromise with, the causeless and wicked rebellion now striking at the vitals of the nation, and their determination is fixed to  endure  and  fight,  and  sacrifice,  till  the  government  established  by  the wisdom,  the  patriotism,  and  the  blood of our fathers is restored in its beneficent and rightful sway over every portion of our Union. The struggle in which the Nation is engaged, is clearly one of life or death.  Even though the scenes of blood and the night of calamity through which we may be called to pass, shall shake the land to its foundation and try us to the utmost, yet, trusting in the God of our fathers, we will not doubt that life is to be the result, and that the nation  is  to  be  purified  by  its  trials  and  established  and  exalted  even  beyond  the  expectations  of  its  founders.  Our  fathers  found  a  great  evil, which  they  deplored,  but  could  not  separate  from  the  good.   Current  events  are tending to produce that separation, by uprooting the evil.  The rebellion, if persisted in may be the means, under Providence,  of  annihilating  the  institution  of  slavery,  which  all  acknowledge  to  have  been  its  cause.    The territory of the United States must be preserved in its integrity.  Neither foreign power nor domestic insurrection can be allowed  to establish a  rival Government within any portion of  that  territory, and  therefore, all necessary means  justified  by  the  ultimate  law  of  self-preservation  and  compatible  with  Christian  civilization,  must  be applied to the permanent suppression of the present rebellion.   The recent Proclamation of Emancipation by the President  of  the  United  States  is  a  logical  result  of  the  slaveholders’  rebellion,  and  as  such  it  is  accepted,  and will  be  sustained  by  all  loyal men.    It  is  a  “military  necessity,”  and  has  the  recommendation  to  our  people,  of according with both justice and humanity.  Gentlemen of the Senate and  House of Representatives: Grave  and  weighty  responsibilities  rest  upon  us  in  this  great  crisis.  Let  us  show  ourselves  equal  to  our duties.  Whatever we have to do, let us do it with one heart and one mind. However humble, we are a part of the American Union, and have a vital  interest  in  its preservation.    It  is a Union consecrated  to Freedom, and  it  falls to our lot and that of our generation to prove the ability of freemen to defend and preserve their birthright.   Our institutions  are  passing  through  a  baptism  of  blood.    They  must  and  will  be maintained,  at  whatever  sacrifice; and  in  the momentous  issue which  is upon us, neither  temporary  reverses will discourage, nor partial  successes unduly elate us.   Relying upon  the  incontrovertible  justice of our cause,  the bravery, patriotism and  intelligence of  the  soldiers  of  the Union,  the  unconquerable  determination,  and  the  spirit  of American  liberty  actuating  the loyal people of the country, we may confidently look forward to, and patiently await, the time when our beloved Republic,  under  the  providence  of  God,  shall  be  re-established  in  unity  and  power,  and  afford  a  triumphant vindication of the capacity of a free people to govern themselves.  FREDERICK HOLBROOK.   EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, Montpelier, Oct. 10, 1862.
