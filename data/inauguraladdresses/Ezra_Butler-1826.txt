Executive  Speech of  Ezra Butler  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume VII.  1826      SPEECH OF GOV. BUTLER– 1826 1 .   Gentlemen  of  the  Council  and  Gentlemen  of  the  House  of  Representatives:  –The  recent  election,  made  by the  enlightened  freemen  of  Vermont,  has  laid  me  under  obligations  deeply  affecting,  and  called  me  to  the performance  of  duties  that  ought  to  excite  and  bring  into  action  all  the  powers  I  possess,  for  the  promotion  of the  public  good.  The  approbation  of  my  fellow  citizens  of  my  past  services  in  subordinate  stations,  in  which they have heretofore placed me, implied by their suffrages in the present election—a favor I have never sought, never expected, but has been freely given—I view as the greatest reward in their power to bestow. It is received with the deepest gratitude.  As to the future, the same honest intentions that have marked the past, will direct my conduct. I should, however, shrink from  the  trust assumed, but for reliance on  that kind, overruling Providence, from  whom  I  have  so  often  found  support,  and  upon  your  good  will,  indulgence  and  co-operation.  With  the hope of these, I engage in the work before me. Those who are the best acquainted with my past conduct will expect a frank disclosure of my own views on every  occasion  when  duty  requires  it.  In  making  a  few  remarks,  not  so  directly  connected  with  the  ordinary duties  of  legislation,  but  of  no  less  vital  interest  to  the  community,  apology may  be  thought  necessary;  and  the only  one  I  can  make,  is  the  ardent  desire  felt  for  the  future  prosperity  of  our  country.  However  conscious  I might  have  been,  that my  talents were  capable  of  doing  but  little  good  or  hurt,  opportunities  for  both  have  not been  wanting.  Ever  since  the  adoption  of  our  constitution,  with  the  exception  of  three  or  four  years,  I  have constantly  had  a  direct  concern  in  the  legislation  of  this  state,  or  that  of  the  general  government.   Neither was the  freedom  of  our  country  obtained  without  my  participating  personally  in  her  sufferings.  Thirty  years  ago, fears were  suggested  that  the great body of  the people of  this country would not at  this  time  find  themselves  in possession  of  those  political  privileges which  they  now  so  richly  enjoy. At  that  early  period,  I  firmly  resolved that my own conscience should never upbraid me with aiding the loss, if it must be sustained. To that resolution I have adhered; and with a view to perpetuate those privileges, is the object of these remarks. Our  country  has  struggled  through  trying  scenes.  They  have  all  terminated  in  our  political  prosperity,  and resulted in the stability and permanency of our institutions. At present we see her rapidly advancing to that high eminence of national  importance  to which  she evidently  is destined.   The people  in every part of  the Union are in  the  full enjoyment of all  that  liberty which  the honest can desire, both civil and  religious; with  the exception only  of  that  unfortunate  class  of  the  human  species,  held  in  servitude  in  some  of  our  sister  states.  But  it  is confidently hoped,  that  the  time  is not  far  distant when  those  states may deem  it  expedient,  in  accordance with the philanthropic feeling of benevolent individuals and societies, to join heartily in their complete emancipation, in such a way as shall be consistent with the safety and peace of community. In no other part of  the world are  the principles of  freedom  so well understood or so  fully enjoyed. We have just cause  to consider ourselves  the most  favored of  the human  family; and nothing can or will stop  the current of  this  favor, unless  it  is obstructed by our own vice and  folly. Let  the constitution of  the United States be held sacred;  let  none  of  its  fundamental  principles  be  altered  or  undermined;  let  no  amendment  take  place  until  its necessity  is  obviously  shown  by  experience;  let  the  government  continue  to  be  justly  and wisely  administered, and  we  may  then  expect  the  perpetuation  of  our  national  prosperity.  If  morality  and  piety  continue  to  prevail, the  elections by  the people will make  it manifest. The national  legislature will be  composed of men possessing integrity  as well  as wisdom;  such  legislators will  never  betray  the  trust  reposed  in  them.  As  the  same  freemen also  elect  the  members  of  the  state  governments,  the  same  desirable  result  must  follow  as  to  the  internal concerns of  the  respective states.  It was  integrity of heart and sound morality  that guided our  fathers  in all  their sagacious  exertions  to  obtain  for  themselves  and  their  descendants  those  peculiar  privileges  we  now  enjoy. Information  is  of much  use,  but  will  only  produce  its  legitimate  fruits when  united with morality,  and  all who are engaged in its promotion, by their precepts and example, are affording constant aid to good government.                                                  1 From the printed Assembly Journal of 1826. The  general  government  has  given  the  fullest  proof  of  its  ability  and  intention  to  protect  our  country  from foreign  aggression  and  while  it  continues  that  just  and  magnanimous  course  it  has  hitherto  pursued,  we  have nothing to fear from abroad. In the executive of that government we have entire confidence, founded on the best proof that the same policy will be adhered to, during the present administration. The  numerous  attempts  lately  made,  to  amend  the  constitution  of  the  United  States,  will  naturally  call  the attention of  the  state governments. A  subject  so deeply  interesting  to all, will not escape  the  jealous concern of any.    Much  might  be  apprehended  from  such  proceedings,  were  less  reliance  placed  on  the  national  and  state legislatures. So long as the great body of enlightened freemen are in the belief that they now enjoy all the liberty and security  that human government can afford, we deem our country  in no danger of those evils  that would be the natural consequence of an ardent desire of change. Permit me to add, that the people of this state have manifested as strong attachment to their own institutions as  those  of  the  United  States.  During  thirty-three  years,  we  have  lived  and  prospered  under  our  present constitution. Repeated attempts have been made by a small minority to amend or change that instrument, but, on every occasion,  the powerful voice of an overwhelming majority hushed all  to peace, –  silenced all complaints. The  short  periods  for  which  all  our  elections  are  made  the  easy  and  silent  manner  in  which  all  are  discharged from  the public  service, have been  the means by which  time common  sense of a well-informed community has been  carried  into  every  department  of  the  government.  Our  institutions,  ejections,  manner  of  legislating, customs  and  laws,  are  as  strictly  republican  now  as  thirty  years  ago. We  have  greatly  increased  in  numbers,  in wealth, in the arts and sciences, and at the same time equality and friendly intercourse is maintained between all professions and classes of citizens in our state, beyond example. Submissions to the laws has been as uniform, – piety  and  morality  as  much  encouraged,  and  find  as  sure  protection  here  as  in  any  section  of  the  world.  Whence,  then,  the  desire  of  change  and  thirst  for  novelty?    In  depressed  circumstances  they  are  highly  useful, but in a state of unexampled prosperity, if indulged, will prove ruinous.  Community at large has a deep interest in every act of the legislature, and unborn millions may be affected by its decisions.  In all the appointments you have to make, – in all the deliberations in which you engage, your own responsibility should steadily be kept in view. While  calling  your  attention  to  the  immediate  business  of  legislation  before  us,  I  am  not  sensible  that  any material alterations  in  the  laws  relating  to any department of  the government could be beneficially made at  this time.  It  seems  now  to  be  well  understood,  that  alterations  should  be  made  only  in  those  cases  pointed  out  by experience. When these are provided for, let us stop. The  manner  in  which  the  two  houses  have  transacted  the  business  of  legislation  as  pointed  out  by  the statutes  on  that  subject,  has  given  universal  satisfaction  to  the  people.  They  need  no  alteration  to  promote  and cherish the good understanding which has heretofore existed; and the friendly feeling that so fully prevailed the last session is highly important to our constituents. Religious liberty, so well understood and so fully possessed in this state and so firmly established by ancient laws,  has  produced  many  salutary  effects.  Laws  so  just  in  themselves,  and  so  safe  for  all,  could  not  fail  to remove  complaint  and  promote  friendship  between  the  different  religious  denominations  in  community,  and peace among the people. Our  judiciary  system  has  been  often  amended,  altered  and  changed.  The  laws  now  in  force  are  of  recent date, —  the  people  have  not  yet  had  sufficient  time  to  form  a  correct  opinion  of  their  ultimate  effect.  Let  the system  remain  undisturbed  for  the  present,  and  in  process  of  time,  experience will mark  the  path  of  duty  to  be pursued by the legislature on this subject. The  laws  regulating  and  governing  the  militia  will  claim  your  serious  attention.  They  have  been  so  lately revised  and  amended,  that  hopes  are  entertained  that  no  alteration  will  be  found  necessary  at  present.  Much reliance,  however,  must  be  placed  on  information  yet  to  be  received  from  different  parts  of  the  state,  by gentlemen who have been actively employed in carrying those laws into effect. Vermont has never been  inattentive  to  the great  interests of education. This appears  in all  the grants of  land made,  and  in  the numerous  acts passed, having  for  their object  the  instruction of youth. The exertions made on this subject have proved salutary, in a high degree. At  present,  the  people  in  this  state  are  as  well  informed  as  in  any  part  of  the  Union.  A  matter  of  such importance will ever be kept in view by every wise legislature. The act of the last session, making provision for a  permanent  fund  for  the  support  of  common  schools,  is  highly  commendable  and  if  any  means  can  be discovered by which  its  resources may be  increased,  the measure will meet  the approbation of our constituents, and, in some future day, be highly applauded by their descendants. Expenses  of  making  and  repairing  highways  are  very  great,  and  much  importance  attaches  to  our  laws  on the  subject  –  the  public  at  large  are  interested  in  the  improvement  of  those  in  use,  and  that  others  should  be made  where  they  are  needed.  Laws  should  be  such  that  all  may  view  their  duty  and  interest  united.  The  act passed Nov.  3,  1810,  directing  the  disposition  of  fines  imposed  on  towns  for  not  keeping  their  roads  in  repair, appears  to be unwise.  It has often been  the ground of  encouragement  to neglect present duty by  the  inhabitants of  some  parts  of  a  town,  in  the  hope  that  a  large  fine  might  be  imposed,  the  expenditure  of  which  would  be useful  to  themselves  and  expensive  to others, who had been more  industrious.   Principles  similar  are  contained in the act passed Nov. 2, 1821, but in the case provided for in this act, they appear unexceptionable. If  it  should  be  thought  inexpedient,  still,  to  abolish  imprisonment  for  debt,  yet  something  may  be  done  to render commitments  less numerous. Was  the creditor made  liable  for all  those expenses now chargeable on  the town, where  the  indigent  debtor  has  settlement  or  happens  to  reside,  commitments would  be  less  frequent,  and much  cost  saved  that  ought  never  to  have  been  made.  The  justice  and  utility  of  the  measure  unite  in recommending it to your consideration. The appointments you have to make are numerous and important. The peace and prosperity of the state will in no small degree depend on  the wisdom manifested  in  this branch of your duty.  Integrity and ability united  in the same person, are the highest recommend aliens for office, and should be kept in view, in every appointment. In  addition  to  the  ordinary  appointments  to  be  made,  this  session,  a  senator  must  be  elected,  to  represent  this state in the senate of the United States, for six years from and after the 3d of March next. Provision must also be made  to  carry  into  effect  the  43d  section  of  the  constitution  of  this  state,  by  an  act,  regulating  the  choice  of  a council of censors, and fixing the place of their first meeting. For more  than  twenty years past,  the  legislature of  this  state has uniformly manifested  its disapprobation of raising money by  lotteries  for  any  purpose whatever. Last  session,  large  sums were  offered  for  the privilege of selling  tickets  and  drawing  lotteries  in  this  state;  but  every  proposition  of  the  kind  was  rejected  and  it  is believed,  the  great  body  of  our  citizens  are  in  sentiment  opposed  to  raising  money  that  way;  indeed,  the principles of morality  in Vermont must  suffer  a  sad decline, before  this  species of gambling will be  sanctioned by  the  government,  or  approved  by  the  people. The  numerous  sales  of  lottery  tickets made within  the  last  year has  not  been  a  little  surprising  to  many  and  especially  to  those  who  had  personal  knowledge  of  all  that  took place at the last session. If the construction be correct, lately given to these grants anciently made by the state to raise  money  by  lotteries,  by  those  who  are  principally  concerned,  it  is  difficult  to  say,  when  the  business  will stop.  I  would  suggest  for  your  consideration,  the  propriety  of  appointing  some  suitable  person  to  bring  the whole  subject  before  the  proper  authority  and  obtain  a  legal  decision  as  to  all  the  grants  on  which  reliance  is placed for support in this speculation. At the same time, protection may be afforded to many who are exposed to pecuniary penalties. This would accord with justice and sound policy. Economy  is  of  importance  in  all  the  concerns  of  private  life;  without  it,  no  individual  can  long  be prosperous or happy.  It  is as essential  in  the affairs of governments.  It has marked  the general course of  former legislation  in Vermont  and  it  is presumed  the present  assembly will not be  less  frugal  in  the  expenditure of  the public treasure. Experience  has  shown  the  propriety  of  confining  legislation  to  its  legitimate  objects. Considerable  expense to  the  public,  and  great  inconvenience  to  individuals,  have  already  been  the  result  of  indiscretion  on  this important subject. All  communications  to me,  from  any  source,  proper  for  your  consideration,  will  be  seasonably  laid  before you. To  conclude,  let  us  reflect  on  the  past,  and make  a wise  improvement  of  the  experience we  have  had. This will  assist  us  in  our  future  progress,  and  teach  us  how  to  profit  by  our  own  mistakes.  Let  every  one  faithfully adhere to the dictates of his own conscience, and however great the diversity of opinion, individually expressed, may  be,  the  result  will  be  the  united  wisdom  of  the  whole,  –  and  all  may  hope  for  the  blessing  of  Divine Providence on our exertions for the promotion of the public good. I shall often go wrong through defect of judgment. I ask your indulgence for my errors, which will never be intentional;  and  your  support  in maintaining  peace  and  good  order  in  society  –  and  I  humbly  beseech God  our Saviour, whose we are, and whom we ought to serve, to bestow his blessings on our labors, our persons, and our constituents.
