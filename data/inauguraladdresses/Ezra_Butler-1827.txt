Executive  Speech of  Ezra Butler  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume VII.  1827      SPEECH OF GOV. BUTLER– 1827 1 .   Gentlemen of the Council and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: – Called  by  the  suffrages  of  the  people,  I  again  engage  on  the  duties  assigned  me.  On  the  present  occasion permit  me  not  only  to  acknowledge  my  obligation  to  the  freemen  for  their  continued  confidence,  but  my gratitude  to  Him  who  has  protracted  my  life,  and  continued  the  prosperity  of  the  state  another  year.  The instances of mortality constantly  thinning  the  ranks of  those accustomed  to  legislation, cannot  fail  to  remind us all, of the slender tenure by which we hold office and life. It  is  necessary  that  the  business  for  which  we  have  assembled,  should  be  prosecuted  with  decorum, deliberation and dispatch, in order to promote the interests of and give general satisfaction to the people. On the wisdom,  by  you  to  be  manifested,  in  the  numerous  appointments  you  have  to  make,  will  the  reputation,  the peace and morality of the state, much depend. Education  is  of  too  great  importance  ever  to  escape  the  notice  of  wise  legislators.  Many  among  the            well-informed  have  thought  our  laws  deficient  as  they  regard  the  expenditure  of  public  money  raised  for  the support  of  common  schools  —  that  a  proper  board  should  be  appointed,  in  each  county  or  town,  for  the examination  of  those  who  are  to  be  employed  as  instructors;  and  that  every  town  should  appoint  suitable persons to visit the schools. Should it be thought that an act to effect these objects would render the expenditure of  public  money  more  useful  to  community,  you  have  the  example  of  some  of  our  sister  states  for  your encouragement in trying the experiment. To  the  subject  of  lotteries  the  attention  of  the  legislature  was  called,  last  session.  Permit  me  to  ask  your further  attention  to  what  was  than  communicated  for  I  have  seen  no  just  cause  for  altering  the  opinion  then expressed.  The  act  of  that  session  is,  in  my  view,  of  doubtful  tendency.  And  should  it  prove  as  salutary  as  its supporters expected, can never close the door against the admission of an evil allowed on all hands to be highly demoralizing in its tendency. The money received by the state, although expended for the best of purposes, will, never,  fully  compensate  community  for  the  various  species  of  immorality  that  will  have  received encouragement. A  bill  entitled  “An  act  to  abolish  imprisonment  for  debt,”  published  with  the  acts  of  the  last  session,  will claim your  attention. The  subject has  repeatedly occupied  the  consideration of  the  legislature;  and  although  the object  is  desirable,  yet  the  manner  in  which  it  can  be  effected  with  safety  to  all  concerned,  seems  not  to  have been discovered. The bill,  in  its present shape,  is  too complicated  to answer  the best purpose.  It would  increase litigation  rather  than  discourage  it  –  embarrass  the  administration  of  justice,  rather  than  promote  it.  If concealment  of  property  should  be  constituted  a  crime,  and  punished  with  severity  as  such,  executions  might issue  against  the property only, of  the debtor, with  as much  safety  to  the creditor, as  the constitution, or  justice require.  This  subject  is  important—it  has  engrossed  the  minds  of  many  for  years  past,  and  if  nothing  further should meet  your  approbation,  I  hope  the  propriety  of  compelling  the  creditor  to  provide  for  the  support  of  his debtor, during his confinement, will be duly considered. Our  statutes  will  all  pass  in  review  before  you.  But  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  every  unnecessary alteration  is,  not  only  perplexing  and  inconvenient  in  the  administration  of  justice,  but  often  the  occasion  of injurious mistakes. Where the necessity of new enactments has become obvious, let us act without fear; but with due caution. For  some  months  past,  several  engineers,  in  the  employment  of  the  general  government,  have  engaged  in examining  different  routes  for  canals  in  this  state  but  as  to  the  result  of  their  labors  no  information  can  at  this time be given.                                                  1 From the printed Assembly Journal of 1827. A  communication  has  been  received  from  the  ordinance  department  of  the  United  States,  by  which  it appears there is now ready for the use of this state one thousand five hundred and nineteen muskets, as its quota for  the  four  years  last  past.  If  desired,  other  arms  or  accoutrements,  of  equal  value,  will  be  furnished.  These arms will be sent  to any designated place  in Vermont  to which  they can be conveyed by water. As  the arms are not  wanted  for  present  I  have  delayed  to  direct  their  removal  to  any  place  in  this  state;  and  will  still  wait  the order of the legislature in relation to them. Permit me  here  to  suggest  the  propriety  of  landing  these  arms  at Burlington  and  that  they  be  brought  from thence  to some place  to be provided  for  that purpose, near  the  seat of government, and kept  in good order until wanted  for  use.  Should  the  proposition meet  your  approbation,  provision  must  be  made  to  carry  it  into  effect. The  legislature will  then have opportunity  to know  the  actual  condition of  the  arms,  from year  to year, without further expense or  inconvenience.  In no part of  the  state can  they be more  secure, or  to every part more  readily distributed,  should  the  unhappy  necessity  of  using  them  ever  occur.  It  is  to  be  feared  that  most  of  the  arms heretofore received from the United States will be of little further use to the state, should no additional attention be paid  to  the  subject. But  those now  to be  received are, doubtless,  in good order,  and may  easily be preserved in that condition; and as the number will from time to time be increased, your attention to the subject seems the more necessary. Several  resolutions  from  our  sister  states  have  been  received, which will  in  due  time  be  submitted  for  your consideration. The people of this state can never remain indifferent observers of the proceedings of Congress, or the course pursued by  the Executive of  the general government. And we have  too much confidence  in  the  rectitude of our motives,  and  correctness  of  our  views,  to  conceal  them.  So  far  as  the  public  good may  require,  they  should  be made  known.  Let  every  state  in  the  union  do  the  same,  and  it  may  be  of  some  service  to  that  government  on which  we  all  depend  for  national  security,  and  the  protection  of  our  rights.  The  dereliction  of  duty  in  the  last Congress,  so  well  calculated  to  impair  the  confidence  of  the  public  in  the  national  legislature,  is  a  matter  of serious regret.  For that body to refuse protection to the industry of a majority of the people, when the necessity had  become  too  obvious  to  be mistaken,  is  just  cause  of  complaint;  for  it  is wounding  to  the  laudable  pride  of our country.  Had no other important interest been neglected the wound would have been less painful, and might have been borne  in silence. However for  the present, we can but cherish  the hope,  that by  the next Congress all just cause of dissatisfaction will be  removed, and  the confidence of  the people again  restored  to  the Legislature on whose wisdom and integrity the United States are in so high a degree dependent for her prosperity. The  preparations making  for  the  next presidential  election  seem  to  have brought  to  view  political  doctrines that will, when  reduced  to  practice,  endanger  the  stability  of  our  institutions,  and  tend  to  their  final  overthrow.  Among  others  that,  in  my  opinion,  are  dangerous,  this  is  not  the  least  that  is  improper  and  unsafe  to  give  any man  a  second  election  as  President,  however  just,  wise  and  prosperous  his  administration  may  have  been,  for the first term.  This idea is novel and I am inclined to think the remark has been hastily thrown out with but little consideration,  and  will,  when  duly  examined,  be  retracted.  There  can  be  no  better  guide  in  politicks  than  past experience  Look  at  the  present  prosperous  condition  of  the  United  States  —  three  successive  administrations continued  eight  years  each:  one  after  another  steadily  progressing  in  prosperity  and  credit  at  home  and  abroad. Is all this to be forgotten in our future march? Or shall this instructive lesson be improved as a lamp to our path? It  is  true  no  one  can  say  what  would  have  been  the  consequence  if  Jefferson  had  not  received  his  second election  and  Madison,  and  Monroe,  had  shared  the  same  fate  and  all  three,  one  after  another,  had  been dismissed from public service at the end of their first term. But all must know, that the state [nation] would have lost twelve years’ service of  those able statesmen; and  that  too not  the least useful part of their services. Add  to this  the  hazard  and  risque,  of  selecting  three  new  candidates  to  serve  four  years  each.  Let  the  candid  decide whether  the  doctrine  that  has  heretofore  prevailed  is  not  more  safe  for  the  country  than  that  against  which  I contend. Due  consideration will  convince  any  one,  that  it  is  unjust  as well  as  unsafe.  There  is  no  other way  in which the great body of the freemen can express their approbation of the first four years’ administration, but by a  second  election.  Should  that  take  place,  and  should  the  same  course  be  pursued  the  last  four,  the  president leaves the chair of state with the sealed approbation of the nation – his reputation is secure forever, as it ought to be.  Not so with him who receives no second election.  A direct stigma is cast either on his person or his policy.  The  disgrace must  follow  him  to  the  close  of  life;  and  in  the  present  condition  of  society, would  be  visited  on his descendants.   Would it have been just for the country to have treated either of the exalted individuals I have named,  in  the manner  lately proposed  to  treat  every one who may hereafter occupy  the chair of  state?   Had  the constitution been so framed, or should this idea so prevail that a second election can never take place, the honest patriot would always be deprived of the reward he most esteems for all his services – there would be no way left by which  the people are distinctly  to decide whom  they approve and whom  they disapprove.   The good and  the bad, the wise and the simple, are all alike to be thrown aside as useless lumber.  Is this just?  But the injustice to individuals  has  not  been  the  occasion  of  these  remarks.  The  increased  dangers  to which  our  institutions would be  exposed  is  that  which  most  deserves  our  attention.    The  doctrine  against  which  I  protest,  in  its  practical operation, would in all cases deprive the state of the services of the ablest statesmen, at a time when they would be  most  capable  of  being  useful,  and  perhaps  too,  at  a  time  when  their  services  would  be  indispensably necessary  to  preserve  the  country  from  distraction,  and  the  government  from  dissolution.    Again,  the  reins  of government must  be  committed  to  new  hands  once  every  four  years;  and  if  the  views  of  some  are  to  guide  us, they  ought  to  be  taken,  not  from  the  cabinet,  but  from  some  other  employment  or  station,  in  which  they  have had  little  or  no  acquaintance  with  the  duties  they  now  have  to  perform  and  direct.    On  every  occasion  of  the kind,  heretofore,  we  have  given  the  reign  to  no  man  until  he  had  been  well  disciplined,  and  had  become acquainted with  the duties he had  to perform; and had given evidence of his  ability  and  integrity.    It appears  to me  there  is  some  risk  in  placing  the  power  of  the  nation  in  unexperienced  hands,  every  four  years.    It may  be further observed,  that  to unite  the public mind on any  individual  to  fill  that most  important office,  is no  trifling undertaking.   The subject has, on every occasion, employed  the  talents and pens of our ablest and best citizens, with  the  deepest  concern.    And  to  this  subject  the  ambitious  and  designing  will  never  be  inattentive.    If  it  has been so difficult to concentrate the public opinion once in eight years, will it not be much more so, to unite on a new candidate once in every four?  The danger of electing incompetent and designing men, is greatly increased.  Double  the  number  must  be  elected  –  the more  frequent  the  draughts,  the more  difficult  the  choice  –  and  still more doubtful whether it will be good.  The more I have thought on this subject, the more fully I am confirmed in  the  opinion  so  often  expressed  by  the  people  of  the  United  States  –  and  that  the  same  opinion  will  still prevail, we are not inclined to doubt. The  unbending  integrity,  the  wisdom  and  prudence,  of  the  administration  of  the  general  government,  as  it richly  merits,  so  it  will  receive  the  approbation  of  a  sagacious,  enlightened,  and  virtuous  community.    Every year  furnishes  additional  evidence  of  the  wisdom  manifested  in  the  last  presidential  election.    The  wise  and prudent  course,  pursued  by  our  government,  for  twenty-four  years  previous  to  that  auspicious  event,  has  been faithfully  observed,  by  those  now  at  the  head  of  the  government.    The  American  system  must,  and  will  be supported; or the retrograde march of our country will soon commence. Every  exertion  made  by  the  legislature,  to  promote  the  interest  of  the  state,  as  connected  with  that  of community at large, will receive my cordial support. EZRA BUTLER.
