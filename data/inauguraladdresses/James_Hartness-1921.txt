Inaugural address of  James Hartness  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1921    Friday, January 7, 1921 Inaugural Address  Mr. President and Members of the General Assembly: Inasmuch as this is the first assembly in which woman has been a member, it seems most fitting to begin by welcoming woman into active participation in representing our people. Women’s  coming  into  full  equality  in  suffrage  bodes  well  for  humanity.  Women  are  the  most  natural representatives of  the home, for  they come with  the first-hand knowledge of  the home. Man’s work outside has so absorbed his attention  that his keenness of  sense of home conditions has been dulled.  It goes without  saying that  nothing  less  than  the  keenest  sense  can  render  the  best  service.  In  addition  to  woman’s  superiority  in  this respect  we  have  a  thousand  other  reasons  for  being  glad  that  woman  has  been  granted  equality  in  controlling arid shaping the destiny of our State and Nation. It  will  not  be  possible  at  this  time  to  refer  to  all  the  major  subjects  that  must  be  considered  during  the session.  I  recognize  that  agriculture,  forestry  and  the  live  stock  interests of  the  state  comprise  a great  industrial group  and  I  commend  the  most  thoughtful  attention  to  these  and  other  matters  that  I  have  set  forth  in  my campaign  for  the  nomination.  I  shall  avail  myself  of  the  opportunity  to  present  to  the  Joint  Assembly  special messages  on  special  subjects  as  the  occasion  requires.  My  message  today  deals  primarily  with  introductory matter. This occasion should be dedicated to keynote expressions that will lead to the maintenance of the best spirit of  fellowship  and  cooperation. This  spirit will  be  the  greatest  aid  to  us  as we  formulate  our  policies  and  shape our laws to fit conditions of today. We are all keenly aware of the great honor that is ours as representatives of the state. We know that we are intrusted with matters of great import to our people. We  know  we  have  assumed  a  grave  responsibility  to  the  children,  women  and  men  of  our  state,  and  that their interests must be given prime consideration. We know  that  large  interests are always ably  represented, but  the vast majority of our people are  those who take  the  world  as  they  find  it  and  try  to make  the  “best  of  it”.  The majority  of  workers  are  in  that  class.  They never can have adequate representation because their proficiency is in action and not in the artful use of words. Just now  there  is a world wide awakening of  the  toilers;  there  is also an awakening of  the wordmen –  those who  talk and write. Both now see  that  this has been a onesided affair and  that now  the  interests of  the workers, in  the  home  as  well  as  elsewhere,  must  be  studiously  considered  in  order  to  obtain  a  better  basis  for understanding so that there will be a government for the people who work with their hands as well as those who talk and write. The spirit of the day has always been in the hearts of every true lover of democracy. It has been weakened in the  routine  of  life  in  times  of  peace  and  brought  into  full  potency  during  the  world  war.  It  suffered  a  setback with the beginning of our reconstruction period. Now, it must be brought back to its fullest strength. At  the crisis of  the war, when our men and women  in  the service and  their  families were bearing  the heroic burden  of  sacrifice,  the  public  acquired  the  full  spirit  of  fellowship  that went  beyond  the  bounds  of  race,  creed and state. The termination of the war and the celebrations over the heroism of our service men and women and finally the  homecoming,  all  seemed  to  be  a  signal  for  these  service  people  to  put  on  civilian  garb  and,  unfortunately, for all the others to lapse back into pre-war indifference. This  lapse  must  not  be  permanent;  the  hearts  of  our  people  have  been  stirred  to  a  true  spirit  of  fellowship and co-work.  GOOD FELLOWSHIP AND STATE SPIRIT A  general  survey  of  the  state  reveals  that  it  is  impossible  to  fully  set  forth  any  one  of  our  big  problems. There  is  not  enough  time  to  consider  thoroughly  any  one  of  these  subjects.  Further  more,  it  takes  special knowledge of each branch, and that can only be acquired by long experience. We are here  to do all  in our power,  first  to determine  in what way we can most  favorably affect  the destiny of our state, and second to courageously follow that way. There  is  a  definite  and  imperative  obligation  that  holds  us  to making  the  best  use  of  our  energies. We  can accomplish  this  by  team  work,  cordial  relationship,  state  spirit,  faith  in  each  other,  tolerance  of  the  views  of those with whom we cannot agree and recognition that every member has some definite knowledge of some one branch  that may be of greatest  value. We must  recognize  that we  are here  to use our  combined wisdom  for  the benefit of the people, and that our supreme duty is to the homes on which our real Vermont is founded; that we are not here to be swayed by particular interests and we are not here to obtain special favors for our own section or for several sections at the expense of the homes in other sections. The  members  composing  this  Assembly  embrace  men  bringing  to  it  a  knowledge  of  various  needs  of  the state. Each one, by reason of his own experience, has his own unique angle of view, and, naturally enough, each one comes with his home section most clearly in mind. Our  greatest  achievement  for  our  home  section  is  to  be  attained  by  joining  with  others  to  accomplish  the best results for the whole state and in the submergence of sectional interests. A NATION OF SPECIALISTS At  the  present  time we  are  a  nation  of  specialists.    The  principle  function  of  legislature  is  to  provide ways and means by which we can make use of these specialized energies to carry forward the interests of the state, to equalize  the  opportunities  within  the  state  and  make  it  possible  for  us  to  compete  in  the  broadest  sense  with other  states;  or,  to  put  it  in  another way,  to  give  to  the  people  of  the  state  the  best  chance  to  share  in  the most beneficial way in modern progress. Our  watches  are  made  and  repaired  by  men  especially  skilled  in  that  work.  When  we  are  ill  we  call  in  a physician.  We  should  not  depart  from  the  general  principle  of  depending  on  special  ability  when  we  are handling the affairs of the State. The trend of management of the state is in keeping with this policy, for there is no better way to insure good service  for  the  whole  state  than  by  placing  in  office  only  those  specially  fitted  by  experience  for  the  work  in hand. With  expenditures  of  departments  running  in  six  and  seven  figures,  it  is  of  utmost  importance  to  get  the ablest  directors  for  these  expenditures  and  after  having  obtained  men  of  best  qualification  based  on  natural ability, training and experience, the next thing to do is to retain them in office. EVERY DOLLAR WASTED IS NEEDLESSLY TAKEN FROM THE PEOPLE In  expending  state  funds  we  must  keep  ever  in  mind  the  actual  burden  that  always  rests  on  the  people  to raise this money. We must know how hard it is for our people to pay the tax levied, and that every dollar wasted is  taken  from  the people who would have otherwise  spent  it  for  family needs. With  this conception of our  state revenues and our supreme obligation to get the best results for the money expended, we will do well to maintain the  plan  of  having  specialists  in  control  of  each  branch  of work  and  see  to  it  that  all  of  our work  is wisely  and efficiently directed. The farther removed the executive is from actual contracts with the manual work, the more difficult it is for him  to  understand  the worker,  hence  the  greater  liability  of misunderstanding. Unfortunately  a  change  of work seems  to  automatically  change  the  viewpoint,  otherwise  many  executives  who  have  been  in  the  ranks  of  the worker would be able to hold the manual workers’ view.  This separation has made it very difficult to maintain a cooperative relationship.  GROUP EXPRESSION This is one of the real problems we have before us, especially the effect of the group action of these various interests  bringing  pressure  to  bear  in  legislative  matters,  not  so  much  in  our  own  state  as  in  the  federal government and  in  the  states  in which exist very  large groups of workers  in each of  the divisions. We  find  that more  and  more  is  governmental  action  being  swayed  by  the  expression  of  these  various  groups  through  their official representatives. While this seems to be a drifting away from our form of a Republic, it is nevertheless an existing  condition  that  seems  essential  to  protection  of  those  workers  who  have  developed  great  skill  of  hand but have not acquired a special ability in the art of bargaining for themselves. I  believe  one  of  the  imperative  needs  of  the  present  time  is  a  spirit  of  cooperation  of  the  leaders  of  each  of these groups. In Vermont we should build up a stronger cooperate spirit in our grange and farm bureaus. We should build up  a  strong  cooperation  of  the  people  in  each  of  our  towns,  and  to  bring  it  specifically  to  this  legislative  body, we must see to it first, last and all the time that we, the representatives of the people, cooperate, having in mind the  home  interest,  and  at  the  same  time  realize,  as  group  leaders,  that  we  must  legislate  for  the  welfare  of  the whole state. This loyalty to the state has an important bearing on many of the questions that will come before us at this session. In  the  same  way  we  must,  for  the  state’s  interest,  see  that  each  group  presents  its  views  through  selected representatives.  It  is  our  duty  to  see  to  it  that we maintain  the  freedom  of  all  people, whether  in  the  groups  or outside  of  them. We  must  take  no  action  that  will  infringe  the  right  of  Vermonters  and  American  citizens  not embraced in these groups. MAXIMUM HOURS FOR MINORS In the Republican State Platform, under the subject of Labor, there is a paragraph favoring a forty-eight hour week  for  women  and  minors  employed  in  industrial  establishments.  This  of  course  expresses  a  commendable purpose,  especially  for  minors,  but  it  may  not  be  favorable  for  women.  In  times  of  prosperity  and  in  large organizations,  either  industrial  or  mercantile,  the  question  of  hours  of  labor,  minimum  wage,  etc.  are  less difficult  to  adjust;  but  in  dull  times  and  in  small  establishments,  whether  industrial,  agricultural  or mercantile, the  placing  of  a  limit  of  hours  on  the woman’s work may  actually  be  against women’s  interests.  I  believe  this legislative  body will  find  some way  of  expressing  this matter  in  definite  terms  that will  not  run  contrary  to  the women’s welfare and  to economic  law.  I have no doubt  that a careful consideration of  this matter will  result  in some improvement, especially that relating to minors. WORKERS COMPENSATION Another  article  in  the  Republican  Platform  relates  to  an  equitable  increase  in  death  and  accident  benefits under workmen’s Compensation. This I am sure will receive most generous consideration, as will also  the  third article favoring an appointment of a woman inspector for factories.  Under  the  consideration  of  Workmen’s  Compensation  the  question  will  undoubtedly  be  brought  up  as  to what  extent  this  compensation  can  be  made  to  cover  occupational  diseases.  The  manufacturers  as  a  rule  have endeavored  to  eliminate  causes  of  occupational  diseases,  nevertheless,  the  enactment  of  a measure  of  this  kind would  undoubtedly  spur  all  manufacturers  to  use  the  most  healthful  methods  and  means,  and  this  will  bring about a great improvement in the working conditions in Vermont. INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATION In  the  interests of  the workers we must  take  a  firm  stand  for  intelligence  in  administration not only of  laws that  affect  labor  but  any  administration  of  businesses  employing  labor.  One  of  the  greatest  handicaps  is  the incompetence  of  those who  are  directors  of work.  The workers’  interest  and  the welfare  of  the  country  rest  on the wise guidance and administration of the affairs of the country, whether it relates to so called labor problems or  the more general problems; for,  in  the  last analysis, the workers engaged  in essential work constitute  the real backbone  of  the  country  and  must  be  considered  second  only  to  the  fighters  who  defend  our  homes  against hostile nations. FITNESS FOR SERVICE One  of  the  finest  slogans  for  the  workers  is  “Fitness  for  Service”.  This  would  insure  railways  being managed by railway men, and other activities being administered by men of experience in the work. In  the  consideration  of  labor we must maintain  the  spirit  of  hearty  cooperation  so  that  the  net  result  of  our advancement will be  an  advance of  all  conditions  affecting  labor, not only  labor  in one branch of work, but  all the way through, whether it applies to the man whose interest and talents have carried him to a certain point past which he finds it difficult to go, or to those who have gone on from position to position by natural steps through the executive offices. Organized  labor  has  an  opportunity  to  stabilize  social  unrest  by  cooperating  in  the  establishment  of  the correct relationship between the employee and the employer. In the true sense both are workers and when this is understood by both  there will be a better basis  for bargaining. The employer must know  that his position  is one of  great  responsibility  to  the  worker  and  those  whose  savings  are  invested  in  the  plant.  He  is  a  manager  and must keep in close touch with those whose work he is directing. This  is  an  age  of  machinery,  an  age  when  the  advance  of  machinery  has  been  to  facilitate  man’s  effort  to necessities and comforts of life. As machinery advances man is enabled to turn out a greater product for a given expenditure  of  energy.  With  the  development  of  machinery  there  has  come  an  absolute  necessity  for coordination  of  the  workers.  Anything  that  in  any  way  interferes  with  the  most  congenial  and  effective coordination is contrary to the country’s interest and to the workers’ interest.  The  most  common  type  of  wastefulness  is  the  disregard  of  fitness  for  office  and  its  natural  product  – mismanagement in the disbursement of funds and in the misdirection of our state activities. CONTINUITY OF SERVICE The  state  has  a  number  of  its  departments  already  turned  over  to  commissions  or  boards  the  personnel  of which  is  never  abruptly  changed--one  slight  change  being  made  by  each  administration.  This  insures  an overlapping  of  service  carrying  forward  a  uniform  policy  of  organization  and  removes  these  bodies  from  the vicissitudes  of  political  disturbance.  I  can  see  no  greater  chance  for  obtaining  higher  efficiency  in  the administration  of  business  affairs  of  the  state  than  in  fostering  and  extending  this  policy  of  administration.  It leaves each commission and board free to give its undivided attention to the service of the State and draw plans that  in  some  cases  require  long  continuity  of  service  to  carry  into  effect.  Such  plans  and  such  service  are  of supreme importance to the welfare of our people. In view of the value of special experience in each line of work and special knowledge that has been acquired by each commission and board, I commend for your most careful consideration the reports and recommendations made by such bodies. FUNCTION OF MESSAGE AND PURPOSE I am  fully aware  that  the General Assembly  is distinctly a  legislative body and  that  the governor’s message should lay before this body such business as may appear to him to be necessary. I have a firm conviction however,  that we have all reached a point where we feel  that  there  is even a higher service  to  render  than  the mere  technical meeting of  the obligations of office. That higher  service  in  legislation is  one  that  considers  the  hopes  and  ambitions  of  our  people  as well  as  their  physical  needs.  It  is  a  service  that recognizes  the  fact  that  our  people  have  hearts  and  souls  as  well  as  bodies  and  that  our  homes  are  the  real centers of government. MAINTAIN OUR WAR-BORN COOPERATIVE SPIRIT Notwithstanding the great resources we have discovered and developed, and the great resources that are still within our own state ready for development, the one outstandingly supreme opportunity lies in that fine spirit of cooperation  that was  born  of  the war,  it  is  now  our  rightful  heritage. With  it we  can  rise  to  the  demands  of  the days that lie in the immediate future. We may be facing grave danger or we may soon find ourselves in peaceful and  prosperous  times,  but,  in  either  case,  we  must  hold  fast  to  that  war-created  spirit  of  fellowship  and cooperation. It is for us to enlist this same heart interest in carrying forward a work of state development. This must come about by a spirit of industry as well as cooperation in each individual, and then as group leaders we must devote our energies to the best modes of coordination of all activities. All  of  this  activity  demands  the  most  careful  consideration,  for  we  must  make  it  possible  for  each  one  to achieve the greatest results in personal development and in betterment of conditions of home and family. On the part of the individual it calls for continuity of work, of sticking to it when there is apparently no bright future. It demands  first, an  intelligent  judgment of  the best course  to  take, and  then a  spirit of carrying on. Mistakes will be  made.  Combinations  of  circumstances  will  arise  that  will  disturb  our  faith  in  the  plan.  Mental  depressions will come, but  through  it all  there must be a predominance of  the  faith  in  the efficacy of devotion  to work after the plan of procedure has been carefully selected. PRESENT POSSIBLE PROGRESS We  must  not  be  disturbed  in  our  desire  for  progress  by  the  fact  that  we  are  unable  to  achieve  complete elimination of undesirable conditions. The  inequalities,  for  instance, of  taxation may not be eliminated  in many years, but we must take the world as we find it and move forward as far as possible each session, and through it all maintain a good will and abiding faith in our ultimate success. SOCIAL UNREST The conflicting reports that come to us from the outer world, notably Europe, would leave us very uncertain as  to  the  extent Americanism  is  threatened. Our  best  defense  and  our  best  line  of  action,  regardless  of whether or not  it  is  threatened,  is  to  set our house  in order by eliminating  the unjust  inequalities. For  instance,  there  are many whose work  is  of  a  character  that  they  have  neither  time  nor  special  ability  for  presenting  their  cause  or for  enforcing  an  adequate  consideration  of  their  interests.  We  must  give  their  interests  first  place  in  our deliberations. LEADERS MUST REPRESENT THE WORKERS In order, as  leaders,  to  retain  the confidence of our people, we must give  consideration  to  the welfare of  all those who are working  in our homes and elsewhere. Let us  remember  that  it  is not primarily wealth  that we are to  protect. We  are  here  to  protect  the  right  spirit  between  people. We  are  here  to  protect  the  interests  of  those who  are  doing  essential  work,  whether  manual  or  mental. We  are  here  to  encourage  the  heartiest  cooperation and the firmest faith in our government. In this way we will render the best service for all workers, in the home or outside of the home; and, last but not least, we will furnish the strongest possible protection for wealth that is properly administrated. LAW AND ORDER ESSENTIAL TO LIFE With  a  leadership  representing  the  workers  we  will  build  up  the  strongest  spirit  for  the  protection  of organizations  of  men  in  those  industries  in  which  the  efforts  of  men  are  most  effectively  employed  and rewarded.  In  this  way  we  will  make  our  best  defense  against  any  menace  that  may  be  creeping  towards  us, particularly  that  spirit  of  anarchy  that  would  break  down  our  organized  life  upon  which  we  must  depend  for food, clothing and shelter.  FAITH IN OUR OWN PEOPLE For  our  state,  we  must  build  up  a  faith  in  our  capabilities  to  win  success  in  this  world  of  science  and industry.  This  is  necessary  to  enlist  a  genuine  interest  in  the  active  work  of  rounding  out  our  state’s development. PRESENT CONDITIONS Let  us  recognize  the  plain  fact  that,  notwithstanding  Vermont’s  activities  in  dairying,  agriculture,  lumber, marble, granite, machinery building, textile and other branches of industry, the state has not gone ahead in other possible  and  desirable  developments.  This  is  no  criticism  of  those  who  have  been  active  in  the  existing establishments.  The  fact  must  be  acknowledged  that  there  has  not  been  sufficient  attention  given  to  other branches  of  industry  such  as  are  needed  to  increase  desirable  opportunities  for  the  work  and  such  as  are necessary to augment the revenues of the state and the earning power of the people. Vermont,  in common with nearly all of New Hampshire and Northeastern New York, as well as  large areas of  other  states,  has  been  asleep  industrially.    While  it  has  been  asleep  as  a  state,  there  has  been  a  sporadic growth  of  a  number  of  splendid  examples  of  desirable  industries.    These  industries  can  be  multiplied indefinitely. VERMONT’S INDUSTRIAL FUTURE A study of the opportunities of this age reveals that Vermont is most favorably situated in its nearness to the great centers of  industrial and scientific developments of  this country, and  is most favorably conditioned by  the general  aptitude of our  people.   The  great  resources of our  fertile  valleys,  our mineral wealth, our water power possibilities are actually  secondary  to  the possibilities  in other directions.   These other activities will  round out the  opportunities  for  our  people  and  will  greatly  enhance  the  values  of  our  more  material  resources.    The upbuilding  of  the  knowledge  of  these  opportunities  will  inspire  faith  and  confidence  in  ourselves  that  will release  the most  potent  energies  of  our  people;  namely,  the  industrious  spirit  inspired  by  confidence  and  heart interest. A study of  the elements  that are essential  to progress will show what have been our stumbling blocks  in  the past  and what must  be  our  course  in  the  future.    It will  bring  out  the  cardinal  principles  that must  be mastered and from which we must plot our sailing course. AGE OF SCIENCE AND MECHANISM We  now  know  the  significance  of  the  age  of  machinery  –  of  the  science  of  mechanism  and  industrial opportunities  for  Vermonters  in  the  various  professions,  offices  and  trades  that  are  embraced  in  these  modern organizations – that these industries greatly augment the income of the people and the state. We  know  that  the  fertility  of  the  soil  of  the  valleys  of  Switzerland,  Massachusetts  and  Illinois  did  not prevent  the  people  of  those  places  from  making  the  best  watches.   We  know  that  any  one  of  all  the  desirable industries might have been started  in Vermont, so  far as any physical  limitation exists here, and  that  this  is  true of many that are now starting elsewhere. We  must  recognize  that  industrial  development  is  still  in  its  infancy  –  that  the  science  of  engineering  is bringing  forth myriads  of  elements  that  are  continually  changing  the  conditions,  so  that  there  is  now,  and  will probably continue for many years, a flow and ebb with many eddies of opportunities in this fascinating world of applied science. WE MUST USE BEST IMPLEMENTS The  history  of  the  human  race  may  be  divided  into  epochs  that  have  been  created  by  the  discovery  and utilization of new resources.  When we speak of the stone age, the bronze age, the iron age, the age of steam and the present age of machinery, we mean  the epochs  in which man discovered and used  these  things  in providing for his needs. The discovery and use of each new means for aiding man in his work have resulted in giving the first users a marked  advantage.    The  man  who  lagged  behind  found  himself  inadequately  equipped  in  his  contest  with  the more progressive man. In  this  machinery  age  the  intricacies  of  mechanism  have  gone  far  beyond  the  simple  structures  of  the preceding  ages,  but,  nevertheless,  all machinery may  be  classed  as  implements.   We  used  these  implements  to aid us in agriculture, harvesting of food, transportation, production of clothing and shelter and so on through the entire list of human requirements. The  greater  complexity  of  these  machine  implements  has  taxed  the  human  mind  to  its  capacity  in  each branch, and has resulted  in so many branches  that  the human mind  is not big enough  to comprehend  the whole.  This  resulted  in  a  failure  of  some men  and  some  states  in  their  attempt  to  keep  pace with  the  progress.    Those who have  failed  to keep  in  the  forefront of  this progress have  labored at a marked disadvantage and such  is our present systems of manufacture and business that having once lost a position in the column of progress it is well nigh impossible to regain it. In  this  Assembly  everyone  comes  under  the  head  of  specialist.    It  may  be  agriculture,  law,  medicine, banking,  taxation,  economies,  and  a  thousand  other  heads  and  subdivisions  of  these  sciences,  but  as  an Assembly,  we  act  as  laymen  when  we  consider  some  branch  in  which  we  are  not  specialists.    Therefore  the main  stress  of  my  message  is  to  commend  the  most  careful  and  considerate  attention  to  each  man  and  each department in presenting its views, reserving for ourselves the task and responsibility as laymen of coordinating the work of all. CENTRALIZATON AND DECENTRALIZATION In these days of extreme views on the question of centralization and decentralization, it will be well for us to review for a moment some of the elements of these two extremes. The extreme views of each preassumes  the maintenance of an all-wise control at  the head or heads  that will devise  a  system  of  co-ordination  in  which  all  the  workers  become  specialists  in  the  truest  and  best  sense  – specialists whose minds are not deadened by the routine of work, but, on the contrary, whose work is so handled that each one preserves that supreme quality of initiative that brings about a continuous evolution toward greater efficiency and higher spirit throughout. Such is the ideal, but, unfortunately such ideal is never fully attained. The  advocates  of  decentralization  do  not  go  to  the  extreme  of  Bolshevism,  but  they  see  that  the  farther removed  a man  is  from  the  actual  contact  to  the work  the more naturally he gravitates  to  an  indifference  to  the opinions  expressed  by  those  who  have  gained  their  knowledge  by  actual  experience  in  the  real  world  –  the working world.   They see  the great need of a more  intimate relationship between  the worker and  the director of work. Some  of  our  ablest  workers  in  this  country  are  desk  workers.    They  are  able  to  formulate  and  present  in words, plans  for  the  actual workers  in  each branch of  the work, but  the  tendency  in many  cases  is  to  lapse  into the routine of the work to an extent that the spirit of initiative – that greatest of all progressive qualities – is lost. In  our  own  state  and  in  our  industries  we  must  get  away  from  the  deadening  effect  of  this  type  of  desk director or manager.   When one  reaches  the point of bureaucracy  that considers  it possible  to create  the  skill of an  artist  or  workman,  or  the  technique  in  invention  or  industrial  development  by  the  mere  use  of  words,  then bureaucracy has gone word, formula and plan-mad. The object of these statements is to emphasize the need of our steering clear of this deadening effect of mere “office  holding”.    It  is  a  disease  common  to  both  centralized  and  decentralized  control,  but  the  advocates  of each assume it is wholly a disease of the opposite plan. I  know  of  no  way  by  which  our  country’s  progress  can  be  more  effectively  blocked  than  through  office-holding desk-type of control that kills the spirit of initiative. The  heads  of  the  departments  must  be  in  thorough  touch  with  the  actual  work.    The  personal  observation and  contact with  the  functioning of  a department  in  the  field  is of  supreme  importance.    It  is  there  that work  is directed.  All the words in the dictionary, grouped in all possible combination of orders, cannot take the place of personal direction in effective work. There  is  just  one  place  to  acquire  a  true  conception  of  the  work,  and  that  place  is  in  the  work,  not  merely near it, although that is better than stationed at a desk in a remote office at Washington or Montpelier. It  is  not  my  purpose  to  suggest  any  radical  or  abrupt  changes  in  the  administration  of  our  state.    A  true engineer  always  builds  on  habit,  cooperating  and  contributing  his  mite  to  the  great  and  valuable  working knowledge that is possessed by the people. I am presenting at this time some reference to the Workers, Industry, and Air Transportation.  Other matters will be taken up later, after considering the forth coming reports of departments. I commend to your most earnest consideration the reports of the various commissions, boards and offices.  I believe we can do no better  than  to give greatest weight  to  the views and recommendations of  these bodies and men  who,  as  a  result  of  close  and  long  application  to  their  problems,  are  now  presenting  their  reports  and recommendations. It  is  not  my  purpose  to  separate  out  any  one  of  these  for  more  specific  commendation  than  accorded  to others,  but,  in  view  of  the  special  interest  that may now  be  centered  on  the  bulwark  of  our  homes  –  the  school system,  –  I  especially  commend  and  urge  a  careful  reading  of  the  State  Board’s  report  giving  the  story  of  the working of the present law and the proposed climax of its endeavors for the boys and girls of Vermont. BUSINESS DEPRESSION Before  closing  this  I  find  it  my  duty  to  impress  on  this  body  the  seriousness  of  our  present  depression  in business.    At  the  present  writing  there  should  be  no  appropriation  recommended  that  would  not  be  in  keeping with  the  conditions  of  prolonged  and  most  unfortunate  depression.    If  the  depression  continues,  some  definite action  should  be  taken  to meet  the  exigencies,  but,  regardless  of  the  outcome,  let  us  guard well  our  resources.  Let  us  be  free  from  the  charge  of  spending  one  single  dollar  needlessly,  or  of  forgetting  for  one  moment  that each dollar has been taken from our homes either directly or indirectly. CONCLUSION In conclusion of  this  introductory portion of  the message,  I wish  to assure you of my warm, cordial attitude towards  each  member  of  the  assembly.    While  I  am  fully  cognizant  that  I  am  a  new  member  of  the  great political family of the state, and undoubtedly a transient in office, there has been no incident in the whole year’s experience  in politics  that has produced  ill feeling  towards a single member of  the family.   On  the contrary,  the net  result  has  been  a  heart  interest  in  the  work  and  the  workers,  and  while  functions  of  the  executive  and legislative  branches  of  the  government  are  distinct,  there  is  a  need,  and  at  the  same  time  the  strongest  purpose and desire on my part, to create and maintain the finest spirit of fellowship and cooperation.  CHAPTER II THE WORKERS The  title  of  workers  is  a  broad  one  that  includes  all  people  who  are  performing  some  essential  mental  or manual  work.    In  a  narrow  sense  the  public  now  makes  a  distinction  between  the  mental  and  manual.    The “labor”  problem  is  one  that  relates  primarily  to  organized  manual  workers,  or  in  other  words,  labor  that  is organized  into  trade unions.   In a general consideration of  the subject we must adhere  to  the broader aspect, for there  is  no  sharp  distinction  between  the  two  groups.    The  manual  worker  in  these  days  must  use  his  brain  as well  as  his  hands,  and  is  therefore  both  a manual  and  a mental worker.    Furthermore  there  is  a  natural  drift  of the  worker  toward  the  executive  positions  in  which  the  mental  work  predominates.    Nevertheless  we  must recognize  there  is a division of work  in  the  skilled  trades as well as  the unskilled  in which  it  is very natural  for men to organize into groups made up of men having a common interest.  We have such groups in all professions as well as trades. These men in such groups see their own side much more clearly than the other side.  Now the great problem of statecraft is to bring together men of all factions so that all may get the broader view.  This broader view is of greatest value in determining our attitude and action. Two  extreme  views  that  are  the  hardest  to  harmonize  are  the  views  held  by  the  manual  workers  in  an industry and the views of the executives. We  must  establish  a  better  connection  between  the  management  and  the  workers  if  we  are  to  obtain  the highest  result  in  coordination.   Let us  remember  just what we mean when we  say  the  highest  result.   We mean the  protection  of  this  country  against  enemies  in  and outside of  the  country,  for  it  is  the  industrial  strength  that makes  our  military  strength  –  that  protects  us  against  foreign  enemies  –  and  it  is  the  industrial  harmony  and good relationship between man and man that will free us from the spirit of radicalism. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ERA Vermont is entering a new era, and that entrance will be facilitated by the intelligent action on the part of the leaders.  Labor, for instance, is coming to see that it has a right to demand and obtain special fitness for all men who direct industrial, state or national activities.  So-called capital has always demanded that a workman should have special fitness for his job but now the worker as well as all other citizens will demand fitness in its leaders.  The  people  are  entitled  to  have  such  leaders  for  only  such  leaders  can  lead  forward,  and  only  under  such leadership can men accomplish  the most  for a given expenditure of energy, and hence  it  is  such  leadership  that will make  possible  the  largest  pay  and  progress.    This  demand  for  competent  leaders  is  the  very  best  basis  for labor and the public in general from which to get other objectives.  It may be considered of supreme importance for its attainment brings all other desirable results. Mismanagement  of  state  and  country  plays  directly  into  the  hands  of  competing  states  and  competing countries.  Our freedom as individuals, as towns and states can be gained and maintained only by conforming to the economic requirements of our day. The  great  intricacy  of  the  affairs  of  the  world  at  the  present  time  is  fully  illustrated  in  the  bigness  of  the problems that confront the state, not only the size of each problem, but the diversity and number of problems. The  reports  of  the  heads  of  the  various  departments  combined  with  their  recommendations  form  the  best basis in considering legislative action. One  of  the  functions  of  the  executive  and  legislature  is  to  take  the  broad  and  necessary  superficial  view  of each one of  these activities and determine  the measure of our  funds and energies  that may be expended  in each one of the developments.  CHAPTER III INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT The general plan of increasing the industrial activity in Vermont must proceed from the truest conception of the fundamental principles governing industrial life. Of  the  distinctly  engineering  phases  of  the  question  I  have  said  nothing.   That  there  is  required  the  highest type of engineer goes without saying, but those engineers are now in our state and many more are growing up in our industries, schools and colleges. I have said nothing of the science of machine design – of the technique of invention and of the thousand and one  problems  of  mechanical  engineering;  not  that  these  are  not  absolutely  essential,  but  that  such  knowledge must be gained by long study and long experience. I have emphasized  the supreme need of experience as a basis of success as a worker and an executive.   The general  principles  set  forth  have  been  those  that  are  most  commonly  disregarded  by  our  technical  engineers, industrial managers and employers. In  all  plans  that  fit  this  day  of most  complex mechanism  and  social  life, we must  start with  the  assumption that  a  certain  degree  of  knowledge  already  exists;  then  proceed  to  set  forth  those  elements  that  are  most commonly  disregarded,  undervalued  or misunderstood.    Such  has  been my  plan  in  setting  forth  these  elements of industrial and human life. The  object  of  a  plan  is  to  get  an  action  that  would  not  otherwise  come,  hence  it  is  natural  that  the  full significance  of  the  plan may  not  be  understood,  but  nevertheless  it must  be  accepted  tentatively  and  followed.  Hence,  since  all  progressive  work  must  be  taken  on  faith  by  those  who  are  not  in  closest  touch  with  the  art,  I bespeak your confidence and cooperation.  Publicity  is  necessary.    The  general  principles  of  industrial  development  of  the  individual  and  the  group must reach the workers, the boys and girls in schools, the men and women in all Vermont. This  can  be  attained  by  the  pamphlet  publications  of  the  state.   The  distribution  should  be  according  to  the subject  matter  and  the  field.    The  postage  could  be  saved  in  many  cases  by  local  distribution  under  the cooperation  of  local  chambers  of  commerce  or  other  civil  volunteer  bodies.    Corporations  should  cooperate even in their own interests. SOME PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTIRAL LIFE In setting forth some of these principles I have selected those that are specially applicable to Vermont. We are more  interested  in  the betterment of  the opportunities  for progress for  the worker  than we are  in  the mere plan for enriching the few. We must  strive  to establish desirable  industries.   The most desirable  industries are  those  in which  there  is a natural  development  of  all  the  workers  and  a  chance  for  the  greatest  number  to  find  the  best  opportunity  to acquire  special  skill  and  special  ability.    In  such  industries  there  should  be  the  open  door  of  progress  so  that those  who  are  qualified  for  advancement  can  go  forward  from  position  to  position  with  no  barrier  other  than their own mental or physical limitations. Our plan should be to inculcate a knowledge of the ways by which man works most effectively –  How groups of men achieve the highest results in expenditure of given energy. What is necessary to establish such conditions. What are the most desirable opportunities. Why the need of building up habit-action. How  a  group  of  men,  through  team  work,  acquires  a  group  habit  action  by  which  their  product  greatly exceeds the product of the same number of men working without cooperation. How  the  individual  ability  and  skill,  as  well  as  the  group  ability  and  skill,  is  only  to  be  acquired  by repetition that establishes habit-action. Why words cannot make industries. Why books cannot teach skill. Why legislation cannot create invention and initiative. Why  industrial  managers  should  know  the  cardinal  principles  of  invention,  of  industrial  engineering, industrial management, industrial relations and the human factor in engineering and in the industries. Why  a  plant  may  be  growing  and  paying  dividends  and  still  be  dead  so  far  as  the  spirit  of  enterprise  is concerned. Why  some men  try  to manage  industrial  plants  regardless  of many  of  the  cardinal principles  of  progress  of workers and the state. Industrial  organizations must  compete with  the world,  and  their management must  conform  to  natural  laws of  engineering,  industrial  life,  individual  welfare  and  economics.    They  go  forward  on  the  fitness  of  men  for service  and  the  congenial  nature  of  each  man’s  profession  of  work.    Each  man’s  energies,  both  mental  and physical, must  be  employed  constructively with  the minimum  disturbance.   His  energies must  be  concentrated on his own particular work.  This concentration applies to all workers and executives.  This plan is based on the fact  that,  through  continuity  of  attention  and  application  to  a  given  work,  man  acquires  a  special  aptitude.    It also  recognizes  that  each  man  on  the  face  of  the  earth,  from  the  tramp  along  the  railroad  to  the  most  highly developed  scientist  and  executive,  has  a  special  knowledge  and  special  ability  that  he  has  acquired  by experience. HUMAN FACTOR In  the  industries  every  well  managed  organization  takes  into  consideration  the  human  factor.    The consideration  of  the  human  factor  shows  the  heart  as  well  as  the  brain  of  each  man.    This  interest  must  be satisfied,  for  it  is  from  that  source  we  get  the  inner  urge  that  controls  all  energies.    It  is  the  basis  of  the  best relation between men.  It is back of the desire for gain.  The heart interest is nurtured when men are organized in work in which there can be a mutual regard and respect and in which there is a minimum conflict of interests. It  is  needless  to  say  that  in  competition  with  the  whole  world  there  must  be  alertness  every  day  in  the guidance of details of mechanism and business, and that it is not by gathering together a group of men at the end of  the  year  or  even  once  a  month  or  once  a  week  that  business  can  be  effectively  managed.    It  is  a  continued application to the work every day and every hour that counts. EVERY MAN IMPORTANT It  is  also well  known  that while  one man  can  wreck  an  industry,  one man  cannot make  one.    A  successful industry is one in which the whole organization consists of men the fittest for their respective jobs.  This fitness for the work is essential, whether it is the work of management, or handling the finances; looking after the sales or  any  of  the  other  various  divisions  of  present  industrial work.   This  special  ability  is  acquired  by  experience, and  that  experience  must  be  obtained  in  the  work  itself,  and  it  relates  to  something  more  than  just  skill  and ability  of  its  workers  into  one  coordinated  whole,  and  it  is  the  coordination  of  all  those  things  that  makes  it successful,  so  that, while men  are  fitted  into  an  industry,  and while  it  is growing under  the gradual building up of the individual and coordinated ability, the men are developing in many beneficial ways. In  the  first place  there  is  a minimum  strife,  a minimum  competition among workers.   Each as an  individual has  his  own  kind  of work  to  engage  all  of  his  energies,  and  each  has  the  satisfaction  of  knowing  the  degree  of success he has attained. DISORGANIZING AGENCIES We  have  said  that  one  man  can  wreck  an  industry,  and  it  is  a  painful  fact  that  many  industries  have  been wrecked  by  well  intentioned  but  incompetent  managers.    Very  little  has  been  written  about  the  supreme necessity of special ability of each man and the complete coordination of all the workers in an industry, and the fact that this special ability and this complete coordination cannot be established except by those experienced in the work  itself.    It  takes years  to build up  this special ability and skill  to  its highest point and a  long  time  to get the cooperative action of the group. The  mere  change  from  one  building  to  another  is  disturbing.    The  mere  change  in  the  slightest  feature  of details of design is disturbing.  And, while there must be progress both for design of machinery and for the men in  the  work,  in  order  to  keep  the  organization  progressing  and  the  men  moving  forward,  it  must  always  be recognized  that  these  changes  and  progressive  methods  must  be  made  with  full  knowledge  of  the  disturbing effect. Our  success  will  be  due  to  our  getting  these  facts  so  deeply  impressed  that  there  is  a  definite  action produced.  It  is  not  unusual  to  get  a  verbal  acceptance  of  these  statements  of  principles  from  some  one  who  in action goes directly contrary. TYPICAL EXAMPLE Henry  Ford  is  one who  practiced  specialization. He would  not  change  the  bonnet  of  his machine  for many years,  when  every  one  demanded  a  little  different  style.  It  undoubtedly  cost  millions  of  dollars  when  he  did make  the change.  It was Henry Ford who applied  the practice of specialization with  the  full knowledge  that  the human being was a creature of habit, and whether he was in an executive position or one of the workers he must be  given  a  chance  to  develop  his  highest  abilities  by  being  permitted  to  give  continued  service  without disturbance. By  practicing  these  principles we  all  know what Henry  Ford  has  done  towards  giving  the  country the  “Chariot  of  Democracy”  frequently  called  the  “Flivver,”  and  by  giving  a  host  of  workers  the  highest remuneration.    ECONOMIC NEED OF INDUSTRIES The  betterment  of  the  physical  condition  of  the  state  requires  the  expenditure  of  large  funds  that  are  not available  under  the  present  conditions,  Taxes  are  always  burdensome,  but  especially  so  where  the  income  is small. The taxes have already been increased until they have become a very great burden on the people. What  is  needed  is  to  greatly  augment  the  income  of  the  people,  and  increase  the  amount  received  by taxation without  increasing  the  tax  rate. That  this  is  now  possible  is  of  greatest  import  to  our  state  and  people, for  it makes  it  possible  to  carry  forward  all  good work.  It  is  an  all-embracing  scheme  that meets  all  the  issues that have been mentioned. The true plan of progress is one that not only provides larger incomes for Vermonters, but also makes better homes and more congenial opportunities. Some  of  our  problems  are  made  difficult  by  our  failure  to  go  directly  to  the  basic  causes.  Many  of  our largest business interests and greatest activities can be conducted by adhering to certain simple yet fundamental principles, and it is to those fundamental principles we must now look, and we must act true to them if we are to avoid the criticism of having mismanaged the interests of the people. SEEDLINGS AND CUTTINGS Volumes  have  been written,  advising  us  how  to manage  industries,  but Vermont  should  take  thought  and  a rational  action  that will  fit  the  needs  of  her  people. The  scheme  for  the  state would  be  one  by which  seedlings and cuttings would be taken from desirable industries in order to start new units.  The  handicap  that  usually  prevents  the  growth  of  small  industries  to  larger  ones  has  been  the  lack  of understanding of some of the fundamental principles of industrial plant growth.  Men who invest their money in such  things  fail  to  realize  that  through  the  early  years  an  industrial  plant  needs  most  careful  nurturing,  It  is  a very  common  experience  to  see  a  plant  that  is  growing  naturally  into  a  successful  organization,  yanked  out  by the roots by a board of directors who wish to examine the thing to see when it will begin to bear fruit.  First  of  all  let  us  recognize  that  notwithstanding  the  complexity  of  the  industrial  and  the  human-industrial problems  that  there  are  a  few  simple  rules  that  settle  nearly  every  fundamental  question  of  industrial development. Failures  in  the  past  in  attempts  to  increase  the  industrial  activities  of  the  state  have  been  due  in  a  large measure to our going contrary to one or more of certain basic rules governing plant creation.  Vermont’s best way  to create more  industries and  to speed up  the growth of present plants  is  to give widest publicity to information regarding industrial plant life — how it starts, what helps and what hinders, who are the men who do such things and what has each Vermonter to do to carry forward this plan that increases the welfare of all.  PRESENT ACTION These  things  start  from  the  ideas  that  come  into  a man’s  head when  he  reads  about  them. The man  helps  if he  passes  along  hope  and  faith.  He  hinders  if  he  sows  seeds  of  distrust.  The men  who  do  things  are men  who have  gained  experience  in  successful  industries,  who  have  faith  in  other  fellow-men  and  boost  them,  and cooperate year in and year out, glad to see everyone gaining ground. They are the ones who start and carry on. There  are  many  such  men.  There  are  also  many  men  without  much  experience  but  with  a  vision,  an inventive genius, perhaps crude, but yet of latent value, who can become powers for progress by cooperation or who may become discouraged by ridicule and distrust. The  grandest  scheme  for  the  development  of  the  desirable  industries  embraces  directing  the  energies  of young men  towards  the  acquisition  of  that  special  knowledge  essential  to  leadership  in  the  industrial  line.  The most  immediate means  for  establishing new  industries  is  to  start with  those men who  are  already  in position  to understand such responsibilities.  WHAT IS NOT AN INDUSTRY Perhaps it will be well to state first what does not constitute an industry. Power, transportation facilities, fine buildings,  fine  machinery  and  a  group  of  skilled  workmen,  a  complete  office  staff  and  an  elaborate  system  of fad management  do  not  constitute  an  industry.  Such  an  aggregation might  be  likened  to  a  cargo  ship  all  ready for service excepting that it lacks a captain and navigating officer—some one to determine what kind of a cargo to take, where to go and how to get there. The  greatest  value  of  an  industrial  plant  that  has  everything  but  a work  to  do  and  a  leader  to  determine  its major policies,  lies  in  the skilled workers and able executives  in work and office. The buildings and machinery come next in value, but the whole thing is still worthless without the idea, or the occasional vision. SOME ESSENTIALS First of all, an industry is an organization having a definite thing to do, like the manufacture, we will say, of a  machine  of  some  kind.  It  must  have  a  stable  policy  by  which  all  the  energies  of  the  entire  organization  are effectively employed. It must  have  good  leadership  to  carry  forward  the  object  of  aiding  in  the  favorable  growth  of  the  industry.  This  includes  leaders  for each of  its departments or branches of  its activities. The branches embrace everything from  invention  and  finance  to  every  essential  department  all  the  way  through  to  the  final  department  which observes the functioning of the product in the hands of the ultimate user. An organization of this kind is in one sense an educational institution. It is continually instructing the public in  the  use  of  its  product  as well  as  instructing  its  own workers  all  the way  through  the  plant.  In  one  sense,  the instructors  are  the  men  who  are  the  heads  of  the  various  departments;  they  may  in  that  respect  be  considered teachers.  It  is  an  educational  institution  of  the  kind  that  teaches  swimming  with  the  pupils  in  the  water  rather than in the class room. It teaches men in the organization how to work under the actual working conditions, and it depends,  in  a  larger degree  than other  educational  institutions; on  the progress  that  is worked out by  the men themselves each in his respective position. Each man acquires special ability in the work itself. A  successful  organization  in  these  days  must  be  one  in  which  specialization  of  effort  is  the  constant watchword. The whole organization must be kept closely to a scheme of manufacture that calls for a limited line of action, so  that  there  is a  larger  repetition of  thought and action on  the part of  the workers  than may be  found in  any  competing  organization.  This  repetition  establishes  the  habit  action which makes  the most  effective  use of  the  human  energies  of  mind  or  body,  and  it  is  the  basis  of  the  greatest  progress  in  the  various  divisions  of science. VERMONT IS NOT HANDICAPPED With proper  leadership  a new  industry may be  created,  either by using existing buildings  and machinery of an  industrial  organization  that  has  gone  out  of  business,  or  it may  be  created  in  some  garage  building  or work shop  in  any  remote  part  of  Vermont.  The  first  thing  to  recognize  is  that  transportation  handicap  of  the  most inaccessible part of Vermont is not necessarily a barrier to success. Let us assume that a plant is to be started for the manufacture of  some  article  and  that  its  competitors  are  to be  found, one or  two  in England, one or  two on the  continent  of  Europe  and  two  or  three  spread  over  America  at  remote  distances.  The  slight  handicap  of transportation  could  be more  than  offset  by  the many  other  elements. As  a matter  of  fact,  our  state  is  so  small that  transportation  over  its  length  constitutes  a  very  small  fraction  of  the  average  total  travel  of  many  of  the articles or machines  that might be  selected  for manufacture. The  location of  the  state  is  exceptionally  fortunate for  industrial  opportunities.  Vermont  is  very  close  to  the  great  center  of  America’s  industrial  activity—the forefront of advance of industrial engineering. The cost of power in many machinery building institutions is insignificant. Frequently it does not cost more than  the  cost  of  sweeping  the  floors  of  the  plant,  but  in  these  days  of  high  tension  transmission,  power  can  be taken  almost  anywhere,  and  if  an  industry  grows  in  almost  any  part  of  Vermont  it  may  be  assured  of  electric service. The  competition  with  other  companies  is  of  a  kind  that  would  bring  a  certain  amount  of  business  to  a Vermont  company  if  its  product  was  distinctly  superior  for  certain  services.    Under  such  conditions  it  would cost  less  for  transportation  of  material  in  and  product  out  of  the  plant  located  on  top  of  some  one  of  our Vermont hills than it would for transportation, we will say, from a company in our middle west to a customer in England. ENCOURAGE LEADERS One of  the  first  things  then  to  realize  is  the need of  the  right  spirit on  the part of  the  leaders of  such  things, and  a  better  knowledge  of what  is  essential  for  success.  The  leaders who  grow  up  at  the  present  time  are men who  have  forced  themselves  forward  even  against  advice  of  well  intentioned  friends.  Their  inventive  schemes were ridiculed and their ideas of management generally discredited. It is time now, however, to begin to realize that  many  men  who  are  competent  to  carry  forward  such  projects  are  kept  back  from  such  work  by  this obstructive  and  discouraging  attitude  of  public  opinion.  There  are  many  of  these  natural  leaders  now  in  our desirable  industries. Some of  them will not go  forward against  ridicule. Any organizations  that  they might  start would  surely  go  under  if  not  protected  from  the  natural  action of  the uninformed  stock holders. Building up of the proper attitude toward such things will stimulate the men to concentrate their attention along certain lines of invention and  thought  that will  result  in  the creation of more of  these  industrial establishments and will start us in the right direction. It is the natural way to go. CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE Thus  far  our  activities  for  increasing  our  industrial  establishments  have  been  promoted  mostly  by  our chambers  of  commerce. Our  chambers  of  commerce  are made  up  of merchants more  than  of  industrialists  and even  industrialists  frequently  forget  that  industries  cannot  be  moved  and  that  large  industries  cannot  be established in a minute. It is about as easy to transplant a large pine tree as it is to move a “going” industry. The natural  way  for  these  industries  to  get  into  existence  is  through  the  process  of  transplanting  of  seedlings  or setting out of cuttings. Chambers of commerce, as a rule, do not understand the elements of industrial plant growth. They think that a  lay  board  of  directors  can  intelligently  dictate  the  policies  of  an  industrial  organization.  They  forget  that  an industrial  organization  is  founded  on  engineering  principles  that  embrace  the  fullest  understanding  of  the  laws of mechanism in relation to its use by the human being.  Every  machine,  whether  it  is  a  machine  used  in  the  industries  or  in  connection  with  them,  whether  a locomotive,  an  automobile,  a  watch,  a  mowing  machine,  washing  machine  or  whatever  it  is,  is  merely something to aid the human being. The  engineer’s  inventions must  fit  the  human  being,  and  the  industry  goes  forward  first  by  having  the  best available implements, second by the best coordination of all such implements and human energies. These  statements  seem  to  cover  very  obvious  points,  but  nevertheless  these  points  are  not  fully  considered in  the  various  attempts  that  have  been  made  to  create  industries  and  to  properly  value  the  growing  industries within our own borders. In  the growth of  fruit  trees we do not expect  to get  fruit  the  first year,  in  fact we have  the vision  that makes it  possible  for  us  to  understand  that  a  young  orchard  has  a  value  even  before  it  bears  fruit.  With  the  proper conception of  the elements of  industrial plant growth we must  reach  the point where we will be able  to place a value  on  young  industries.  This  will  keep  the  stockholders  quiet  and  satisfied  and  will  permit  the  natural evolution of the plant and at the same time prevent discouragement of many of those men who are competent to carry such things forward but who may lack in those qualities which are essential to work against opposition. An industry occasionally pays dividends in the first year of its existence. Some, on account of the intricacies of  product,  require  a  longer  period  in  which  to  build  up  special  skill  and  ability  as  well  as  to  develop  the invention.   EXAMPLE OF IMPORTANCE OF EXPERIENCE One  example  of  the  greater  length  of  time  that  is  taken  to  produce  an  intricate  machine  may  be  cited  by reference  to  the development of  the Liberty airplane engine. The Liberty engine was not a great departure  from previous  designs.  It  looked  very  much  like  the  existing  engines  on  the  other  side  of  the  water.  It  did  embrace some notable inventions, particularly in structural changes that were essential for quantity production, but while such  departures  would  have  delayed  the  production,  we  would  have  been  discouragingly  slow  even  if  we  had copied an existing engine in every detail. We know that a pianist cannot acquire great ability in three weeks, nor in three years. Paderewski’s skill and art  were  the  result  of  long  years  of  work.  The  artist’s  brush  as  well  as  the  workman’s  implements  will  not function to the highest standard excepting through practice. The special skill that is required in the development of a new model, especially of the higher tensioned machines, such as the airplane engine, cannot be acquired in a minute. The  special knowledge of  adjusting  such  engines,  and  the general  character  and  inspection  cannot be acquired in a day. It. can only he acquired by experience covering years of practice. Such matters may seem a far cry from Vermont’s  industrial needs, but  it clearly  illustrates  the conditions of public opinion that must be changed. This change can be brought about by full publicity. This will enlighten not only  those  most  vitally  interested  but  also  the  public.  It  is  very  essential  that  these  facts  should  be  fully understood  by  the  bankers,  small  investors,  directors,  workers  in  the  plant  and,  last  but  not  least,  the  inventor and those who must be most closely associated with him in the upbuilding of the industry. GROUP SKILL In  addition  to  the  delay  that  is  due  to  the  working  up  of  the  individual  skill  and  individual  ability  for  the various  members  of  the  organizations,  we  have  the  delay  of  building  up  what  may  be  called  group  skill  or effective coordination of all the elements of the whole organization. Very  elaborate  systems  have  been  worked  up  for  controlling  the  flow  of  the  work  and  the  division  of  the various  activities  between  the  men  and  departments,  but  the  real  effective  coordination  must  grow  out  of experience of  the workers. This natural evolution of  the groups’ effectiveness as a single organization  is one of greatest  importance. The average  theorist coming  into an old plant will start  in at once to rearrange  the order of things irrespective of the group habit-action as well as the individual habit-action. With  the  growth  of  an  industry  as  a  whole  there  is  the  development  of  the  individuals. Managers,  various executives  and  inventors  will  make  serious  blunders;  but  that  is  expected  in  any  organization,  especially  in  a new  one.  The  greatest  harm  may  result  from  a  board  of  directors  insisting  on  some  important  change  in  the management, not realizing that the new management will probably make its own mistakes. One essential  thing  that cannot be emphasized  too much  is  that  interference with  the growth of habit-action is  disastrous.  Changes  should  be  only  for  progress  of  men  and  the  improvement  of  product.  Changes  in  the design  of  the  product must  be most  sparingly made, with  the  full  knowledge  that  it  is  an  interference with  the habit  action  of  the  workers.  All  people  concerned,  whether  as  executives  in  an  industry,  or  as  investors,  must remember  that  in  a  growing  industry,  individual  skill  as  well  as  group  skill  of  the  whole  organization  greatly improves with continued action—that each individual as well as the whole unit acquires high special ability and skill.    Under  the  process  of  continued  action  the  average  man  can  make  a  fair  showing  and  with  a  reasonable degree  of moral  support will make  good, while without  it  the  ablest man will  have  a  hard  time  and  even  fail  if he is forced to accept changes that disturb continuity of action  WORKERS INTERESTS The  workers’ side of this policy is very clear, for by this process the natural leaders come from the workers, and all move forward according to the individuals’ ability.  It is useless to ignore the fact that many men are happiest in work in which they acquire great skill, and they are  not  comfortable  if  harassed  by mental  problems.  Some  of  the  greatest  achievements  have  been wrought  by such men, who have been highly honored in the past and will have more recognition as time goes on, for we are more  and  more  coming  to  understand  the  fact  that  special  ability  in  the  form  of  skill,  whether  it  is  in  the surgeon,  the  instrument maker  or  any  other  branches  intended  to  benefit mankind,  depends  on  such men. Such men  are  not  talkers  and  do  not  force  themselves  into  spectacular  positions.  To  the  outsider  it  would  seem  that there was no progress for the surgeon if he cannot become manager of the hospital, nor for the skilled worker if he cannot become manager of the industrial plant, but we know that such men are of greatest importance and as time goes on they will be accorded higher and higher recognition. The  working  out  of  this  whole  plan  keeps  an  open  door  from  position  to  position  all  the  way  through  the organization, so  that  the ultimate management,  in  fact  the owners of  these organizations,  is  largely  in  the hands of  the  worker.  Not  by  unlawful  seizure  by  the  workers  but  through  early  investment  of  savings  in  the  young plant.  Through  sale  of  patent  rights  for  stock,  or  any  other  mode  of  procedure  that  is  beneficial  alike  to  all investors. MANUFACTURERS OPPOSE NEW INDUSTRIES One  of  the  forces  that  operates  against  increase  in  the  number  of  industrial  establishments  is  the  fact  that manufacturers,  as  a  class,  do  not  realize  that  for  the  benefit  of  their  institutions  it  is  best  to  have  a  live organization  in which men  progress  from  job  to  job;  from  position  to  position  and  even  graduate  to  join  other organizations or to start new industries. The  average  manufacturer  fails  to  see  this  fundamental  law  regarding  the  growth  of  the  manufacturing organization,  and  he  seldom  realizes  the  prime  necessity  of  the  fundamental  law  relating  to  specialization.  He overlooks that stagnation in place of progress of the men in the plant is deadly to the organization. He feels that if  he  gets  an  extra-efficient  man  in  a  certain  position  that  he  must  be  kept  there  regardless  of  his  own opportunity  for  advancement.  He  fails  to  realize  that  progress  all  the  way  through  the  organization  should  be encouraged—that while man  is  distinctly  a  creature  of  habit,  his mind  as well  as  his  body must  be  considered, and that only by changes of a progressive nature he develops most favorably. Many  manufacturers  are  very  much  opposed  to  the  creation  of  other  organizations  by  men  from  his  own organization.  The  average  manufacturer  is  grasping  and  desires  to  embrace  all  the  opportunities,  when,  as  a matter of  fact,  it would be  a great deal better  for his own  institution  if he would  encourage  the growth of other plants that can be created by his own men. Without  something  to  force  us  into  the  scheme  of  specialization we will  automatically  drift  the way  of  the vast  majority  others.  In  the  industrial  work  we  have,  unfortunately,  many  examples  of  what  happens  to  the organization that is allowed to drift away from the policy of concentration to a limited line of work. “DEAD” ORGANIZATION In  all  cities  we  can  see  “dead’’  organizations.  Many  of  these  companies  that  are  actually  “dead”  seem  to have  life  in  them because  they  continue  to move, but  in many  instances  the motion only due  to  the momentum of a push that was given years ago. A “dead” organization may show signs of life in its gradual growth in size, but its real character is to be seen in  the  extent  to  which  it  is  departing  from  specialization  or  by  the  continued  use  of  antiquated  methods  and buildings.  The departure from specialization is generally due to either lack of courage to discard obsolete designs or to an inclination to consider the business from the selling end only. It takes courage to discard an old model and it also takes courage to refuse to build some new invention.  The indifferent management carries the old and takes on the new. This policy covering many years creates a condition that is far removed from the specialization plan. The  management  that  views  everything  from  the  selling  side  of  the  business  also  is  inclined  to  go  on indefinitely increasing the line of goods manufactured. The  drift  away  from  specialization  may  not  be  disastrous  today  or  tomorrow,  especially  if  there  are  no competitors  who  are  specialists,  but  the  inevitable  result  will  be  the  burial  of  the  “dead”  organization  when  a real competitor comes into the field.   The calamity of  the existence of “dead”  industrial organizations  is something more  than  the ultimate  loss  to the  stockholders,  it  is  the  deplorable  stagnation  in  which  the  workers  find  themselves  with  their  progress blocked by an unwise management. WAYS AND MEANS These  facts must  be  stated  to wake  up  our  own  industries  and  also  to  point  out  that  the  inventions  coming from men  in  these organizations  should not be buried  in a catalog of many other  things. Each  invention  should be the basis of a specializing organization. The  essential  work  before  this  General  Assembly  is  to  consider  ways  and  means  of  inculcating  the  fullest knowledge  of  best  plans  of  industrial  life  so  that  everyone  affected  by  such  activity  can  know  how  to  estimate an industry’s prospect and how to conduct their own course in them. Impressing  these  fundamental  facts  regarding  the  best  modes  of  progress  for  man  and  groups  of  men  will produce a far reaching result. These cardinal principles must be understood by all of our people in the home and in the state. It  is  supremely  necessary  for  the  workers  and  executives  in  our  industries  to  get  the  fullest  possible conception of principles governing life and engineering, so that they can see what must be done to promote their own success and also to know what is deadly to their own interests and the interest of the state.  CHAPTER IV AIR TRANSPORTATION Air  transportation  is coming  into extensive use, notwithstanding  the  first and very natural personal aversion to flying. There  was  the  same  aversion  to  the  steamship  and  railway  and.  although  most  of  us  have  forgotten  it,  our first automobile ride was taken with some misgivings as to its safety. But, whether we as individuals ever swim in the air, or continue to remain at the bottom of this atmospheric sea,  the  fact  remains  that  an  important  part  of  our  passenger,  mail,  parcel  post  and  express  will  be  carried  by aircraft. Vermont  was  handicapped  at  each  stage  in  the  development  of  new  means  of  transportation.  There  are practically  no  navigable  rivers  to  reach  its  interior  and  only  limited  connection  with  its  outer  markets  by  our lake.  The  beginning  of  railway  development  was  hampered  by  our  rugged  surface  and  even  now  railway connection between certain parts of our state is lamentably poor, due to our mountain ranges. Our  cost  of  road  construction  and  our  ever  increasing  cost  of maintenance  will more  and more  force  us  to use the airway which is all ready for use and cost nothing for maintenance. There is just one thing necessary to make flying practical and safe and that one thing is the establishment of a chain of landing fields. Each town and city should try to get a field even if it must go five or ten miles to find a suitable flat. The safe flying courses through the state will follow closely to the established fields. The  future  growth  of  towns  will  depend  in  a  large  measure  on  the  alertness  of  making  provisions  for  safe landings  of  aircraft.  The  landing  fields  are  actually  air  ports.  Since  flying  goes  directly  from  port  to  port,  each town will have practically a direct road to any other port in New England and New York.  By the establishment of facilities of this kind, and with the cooperation of our neighboring states, our flying service will begin without further expense. There  are  already  fields  partially  developed  at  Burlington,  Barre,  White  River  Junction,  Bellows  Falls, Rutland  and  Springfield,  and  there  are  many  fields  suitable  for  such  purposes  in  the  western  side  of  the  state. Poultney,  Bennington,  Enosburg  Falls  (near  Sheldon  Junction), Windsor  and  Brattleboro  have  sites  that might be  developed  at  low  cost  to  these  towns.  Many  other  towns  have  fields  that  may  be  converted  into  fairly satisfactory fields by clearing away fences, trees and grading over ditches and hollows. The  airplane  will  come  and  bring  business.  The  establishment  of  hangars,  gasoline,  supplies,  etc.,  may  be left  to  the  enterprise  of  the  merchants.  A  one  hundredth  part  of  the  money  expended  for  highway  work  will provide  a  state  activity  for  selecting  the  most  desirable  locations  and  establishing  a  few  emergency  fields  in localities where the population is too sparce to warrant the expense by the local interests.  I  recommend  the  investigation  of  the  needs  of  amending  present  statutes  or  enacting  new  statutes  for facilitating the acquisition of landing sites by town or under proper state or town control of private initiative.  The Governor having concluded the reading of his message, withdraw, and the Joint Assembly dissolved. HARRY A. BLACK, Secretary of State, Clerk
