Inaugural address of  John McCullough  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1902  Friday, October 3, 1902 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representative: We have come together in obedience to the requirements of the Constitution. This Government is, however, essentially  a  people  Government.  In  Vermont  the  Governor  is  the  titular  head  of  the  State.  He  is  expected  to represent her at public functions. His duties, unless in some great national crisis or convulsion, are neither many nor arduous. In  Vermont,  too,  we  are  fortunate  that  the  powers  of  the  Legislature  itself,  the  law  making  department  of every representative government, are only called into exercise in the mildest degree. The people govern themselves. A State whose citizens have mastered the problem of self government is best governed when least governed. From  its  first  settlement,  through  the  stormy  period  of  its Colonial  life,  during  the Revolutionary  era,  as  an independent  Republic  for  thirteen  years,  as  a  member  of  the  Federal  Union  for  over  a  century,  Vermont  has been educated  in a  school of self-reliant manhood. That  the majority should  rule,  that  the  rights of  the minority must not be  infringed,  that  liberty  regulated by  law must prevail, are  the  lessons  that have been so well  learned by the citizens; of Vermont as to be, and have become, a part of their very being. The civilization of  this people  that had  its origin  in Lower Germany centuries ago,  that crossed  the Channel and  sprouted  and  grew  slowly  with  the  ages  amid  and  against  countless  obstacles  from  within  and  without  on the British Isles,  that budded at Hastings and Runnymede, at Lewes and Naseby,  that blossomed at Bunker Hill and Bennington and Yorktown, at Gettysburg and Appomattox, needs no guiding hand to instruct its subjects in the matters best suited for their welfare and government. Your ancestors who founded this little mountain commonwealth struck off your first Constitution in 1777 in the  midst  of  war,  and  with  the  enemy  upon  your  borders  declared  Vermont  a  “free  and  independent  State.”   And  under  its  rule  and  as  revised  in  1786,  for  thirteen  years  maintained  an  independent  existence;  and  after admission  into  the Federal Union established  the Constitution of 1793, under whose beneficent provisions, and the  amendments  from  time  to  time  adopted,  you  and  your  ancestors  for  over  a  century  have  enjoyed  the blessings of free government; and, so far as human wisdom can foresee, you and your posterity will continue for other centuries to enjoy the multiplied and multiplying blessing of even a freer government. The very  conservative method,  too, providing  for  its  amendment  insures  against  any hasty  innovation  from popular  impulse,  and  assures  that  liberty  regulated  by  law  shall  continue  to  be  the  rule  of  Anglo-Saxon development. The provision of  the National Constitution  that  requires  for  its amendment  the concurrence of  two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, or two-thirds of the States, and then the subsequent ratification of three-fourths of the States, has  received  the highest encomiums of modern political philosophers as one of  the wisest guarantees of good government.  The provision  in our Constitution  is  equally,  if not more,  conservative  and yet  in practical working  there  is little difference. These  provisions  insure  solidity  and  security,  and,  as  is  well  said,  these  are  the  most  vital  attributes  of  a fundamental law. Our  town  system  existed  before  the  State.    It  is  the  inheritance  and  the  growth  of  the  ages  of Anglo-Saxon uplifting.  It was simply recognized in our Constitution. These republics in one form or other have always had their Legislatures.  In their annual March meetings, or at other sessions regularly called, they select their rulers for the year and discuss all public questions and decide what is for the best good of the community and the State; and that judgment expressed at the general election is reflected  in  the persons of  the  two hundred and  forty-six Representatives standing  for  these  little  republics, and in the persons of the thirty Senators representing the counties. The  duty  and  the  responsibility  of  any  needed  legislation  rests  almost  wholly  on  you;  the  function  of  the Executive being advisory. The  retiring  message  of  my  predecessor,  delivered  yesterday,  is  so  full  and  exhaustive  and  gives  such  a comprehensive  review  of  the  affairs  of  the  State  for  the  past  two  years,  accompanying  the  same  with  most valuable  suggestions,  that  it  only  remains  for  the  present  Executive  to  add  his  recommendation  to  the General Assembly to give these suggestions their most careful consideration. The  reports  of  the  various  State  officers  and  of  the  boards  of  trustees  and  superintendents  of  the  State institutions  furnish  you  with  full  information  upon  which  to  exercise  your  intelligent  judgment  in  formulating such  wise  and  prudent  legislative  action  as  the  requirements  of  these  different  institutions  and  departments demand. While  keeping  your  appropriations  safely  within  your  revenues,  I  bespeak  for  all  the  State  institutions,  for your  whole  educational  system,  your  common  schools,  your  normal  schools,  your  colleges  and  universities, your  libraries,  for your Home, your Boards of Agriculture  and Health,  for your  Insane Asylum,  your  Industrial School, your House of Correction, your State Prison, just and liberal treatment. Wisely  and  generous  administered,  such  institutions,  are  the  best  evidence  of  an.  advance  and  advancing civilization. TEMPERANCE LEGISLATION. The verdict of  the freemen of  the State on September 2d last was  in favor of  the General Assembly framing a local option and high license law and submitting the same to the people for their adoption or rejection. This  duty  will  require  the  very  best  efforts  and  the  most  intelligent  consideration  of  the  members  of  the Assembly. For  fifty years prohibition has been  the policy of  the State. The mandate comes up now  from,  the people  to their legislators commanding them to formulate and to submit to them for their decision some other system. This the Anglo-Saxon, the American method. It is the rule, of the majority. And primarily, on  this subject,  it must be borne  in mind  that all sumptuary  legislation must be supported by public sentiment to be effectual. In  framing  a  statute  the General Assembly will have  the benefit of  the  legislation on  the  subject of  eight or ten of the other States. Experience is the very best guide. In  every  State  the  difficulties  arising  from  the  United  States  internal  revenue  laws,  from  the  freedom  or interstate commerce guaranteed by the National Constitution, and from the medicinal and industrial demand for alcohol will always embarrass the enforcement of any law. Different  States  and  different  parts  of  the  same  State  may  require  different  treatment,  Unlike  most  of  the States, Vermont has few manufacturing centres or large  municipalities; the great majority of her towns are rural and agricultural. Massachusetts  is  more  nearly  similar  to  Vermont  than  any  other  State  and  from  her  legislation  probably more valuable suggestions will be derived than from any other source. But in the legislation of no one State, only, should we look for the best and wisest provision and those most suitable to the circumstances of our people. In  any  local  option  or  license    system,  it  is  worthy  of  consideration  whether  the  vote  on  License  or  No License  should be  taken  in any  town or municipality oftener  than once  in  three or  five years; whether  it  should not be taken at elections specially called for that purpose and not at any regular election. State or local; whether if  License  be  voted,  it  would  not  be  wise  to  require  the  petition  of  a  majority  of  the  property  holders  in  any block or  square of a municipality before  issuing a  license whether a majority of  the  legal voters of any  town or sub-division  of  a  city  should  not  be  allowed  to  remonstrate  against  licensing  or  continuing  the  license  of  a specified  person  whether  any  license  should  be  granted  for  more  than  a  year;  whether  the  number  of  licenses where  authorized  should  not  be  limited  to  one  for  every  1,000  inhabitants,  and  prohibited  within  a  limited distance of any church,  school house,  theater, opera house, public building, park or other public place; whether all  licensees  should  not  be  required  to  give  am  bonds,  and  every  applicant  for  a  license  furnish  evidence  of citizenship and good character. As to the licensing body or authorities, it has been well said that judicial purity and reputation for purity are far more important than discreet licensing. It is of the utmost importance that courts and judges should be kept as far removed from politics as possible. This  matter  of  licensing,  therefore,  should  be  entrusted  to  some  other  department  or  to  boards  specially raised up for that purpose, and which boards should have stability and independence. There  should  he  several  grades  of  license  fees  depending  on  the  size  and  population  of  the  towns  or  cities; and the traffic should be made to raise large revenues for both the State and the towns or municipalities. Every  licensee  should  be  restricted  from  selling  to  minors  or  intoxicated  persons,  or  on  Sundays,  election day or any  legal holidays, nor should he be allowed  to  furnish musical entertainment of any kind or billiards or cards or any game whatever; and the place should be wide open to inspection from the street or highway and the hours should be strictly limited, and the shorter the better, provided public sentiment supports these restrictions. If  druggists’  licenses  are  to  be  granted  at  all,  they  should  be  entrusted  only  to  registered  pharmacists  who should  be  authorized  to  sell  only  in  small  quantities  and  only  on  the  written  prescription  of  a  physician  not interested in the store. These suggestions, gathered from many sources, may be of some value in formulating  a proper statute to be submitted to the people for their adoption or rejection. PRIMARY ELECTION LAW. Many  of  the  other  States  have  such  laws,  and  the  enactment  of  a  similar  statute  by Vermont would  tend  to secure purity in nominations. The  caucus  should  be  surrounded  by  the  same  safe-guards  as  the  election.  The  primary  election  should  be held  on  the  same  day  and  hour  throughout  the  State;  check  lists  should  be  provided;  the  choice  should  be  by ballot; and all the precautions of the general election law should be extended to the primary election. GOOD ROADS. In  view  of  the  agitation  on  this  subject  for  the  past  ten  years  or more  in  this  country,  and  of  the  advanced action  taken  in many  of  the  States,  and  of what  has  already  been  done  in  this  State,  it  cannot  be  necessary  for me at any length to urge consideration on your part. Nothing  can  add  more  to  the  prosperity  of  the  State,  nothing  can  serve  to  lift  farm  values  so  materially, nothing  can  bring  summer  tourists  and  residents  to  settle  and  beautify  and  enrich  our  valleys  so  much  as permanent road building. I would  not  only  urge  the  continuance  of  the  present State  tax,  but  I would  advise  an  increase  of  the  same, and even more liberal treatment. And  in  this connection, and as a corollary,  I would  recommend  that  the State begin a  system of elimination of grade crossings of both steam and electric roads and the highways.   The  laws  of  Massachusetts  and  New  York  furnish  desirable  methods.    Proceed  slowly,  but  make  a beginning.   REVENUE. It seems to me, without unjustly or improperly burdening any interest, that all the expenses of the state government can be raised by indirect taxation, and relieve real estate entirely, and I commend this subject to the intelligent consideration of the Legislature. In  conclusion,  permit  me  to  express  the  hope  and  the  expectation,  that  you  will  prosecute  your  legislative labors  with  all  diligence,  and  that  the  results  may  be  the  passage  of  a  few  wise  and  well  considered  measures redounding to the welfare and prosperity of the state whose best interests we are all anxious to promote.
