Inaugural address of  John Gregory Smith  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  Annual Session  1864  Gentlemen of the Senate  and House of Representatives:  After a year of many mercies and great prosperity, as we meet to perform the duties imposed upon us by the constitution  of  the  State,  I would  earnestly  invite  you  to  join with me  in  rendering  to Almighty God  the  honor and  praise  that  is  His  due,  and  to  seek  His  favor  and  blessing  upon  the  deliberations  for  which  we  are  now assembled. I  respectfully  submit  the  following  statement  of  the  transactions  of  the  State  for  the  year,  with  such recommendations as seem to require your consideration. FINANCES. The detailed report of the Treasurer, which I transmit with this, will clearly exhibit to you the financial condition of the. State. From this it appears that the total receipts into the Treasury from all sources have been   $2,327,527 66 122,433 75 Balance September 1st, 1863, -----------------   $2,449,961 41  2,025,864 85 Total disbursements, -----------------   Leaving balance on hand, September 5, 1864, $424,096 56   The amount of funded liabilities is stated to be  $644,982 13 The amount of current liabilities,  429,538 42 The amount of current resources,  Excess of current liabilities,   ---------------- The current expenses of the year are approximately estimated as follows: 775,000 00 Extra pay of $7 00 per month, 150,000 00 Ordinary State expenses, 120,000 00 Interest on loans and funded debt, ------------------   $1,260,443 71   250,000 00 Deduct bonds authorized in 1862 and not issued,  -----------------   $1,010,443 71 Leaving to be provided for by tax or loans,  This  amount  may  be  increased  to  the  extent  of  whatever  expenses  may  be  incurred  in  raising  additional troops. The  balance  due  from  the  United  States  for  raising  and  furnishing  troops,  as  reported  in  my  last communication,  is  about  $60,000  00.  This  amount  still  remains  unpaid.  Efforts  have  been made  to  procure  an adjustment  of  the  accounts,  but  causes  beyond  my  control  have  thus  far  prevented.  The  accounts  against  the United States  for  the current year also  remain unliquidated. These will amount  to about  the sum of $30,000 00.  I hope soon to be able to effect a full settlement of all these accounts. Orders have been drawn by me on  the Treasurer  to September 1st, amounting  to $63,617 48, which may be classified as follows: Services and expenses of recruiting officers, Subsistence of recruits not mustered, $1,425,401 4141 $215,443 71 Friday, October 14, 1864 Inaugural Address     $24,719 84 1,934 82 Transportation of recruits not mustered, Medical attendance and inspection of recruits, Arrest of deserters, Barracks for Co.

In October last, I appointed John Howe, Jr., Esq., of Brandon, agent of the Slate, to furnish the necessary aid to the families of the soldiers. The report in detail of that department is herewith transmitted. From this it appears the amount expended during the past year is $18,700 42.  The number of families aided, 471. Number of aided, 2058. The  transactions  in  the  department  under Mr. Howe’s management  have  been  concluded with  great  ability and  discretion,  and while  the  duties  have  been  delicate  and  the  labors  arduous,  prompted  purely  by motives  of patriotism  and without  compensation,  the  interests  of  the  State  have  yet  been  protected with  great  fidelity,  and the destitute families of  the soldiers have received  that care and assistance which  it was  the object of  the  law  to furnish them. MILITARY. On  the  3rd  day  of August,  1863,  the War Department  authorized  the  raising of  two  additional  regiments of infantry and one battery of light artillery. In  pursuance  of  this  order,  my  predecessor  made  arrangements  for,  and  appointed  the  necessary  recruiting officers  to  raise  the 17th  regiment of  infantry  and  the 3d battery of  artillery,  and  also  to  a partial  extent  the 18th regiment of  infantry.    It was  expected under  this order  that  these  could be  raised  as  veteran  organizations  from the  men  just  returned  from  the  nine  months  service,  and,  as  inducements  for  speedy  enlistments,  the Government authorized the payment of a bounty of four hundred dollars to veterans, and one hundred dollars to new recruits. The severity of the service which experienced in the battles at Gettysburg, which occurred just on the eve of the  expiration of  their  term, deterred  them  from  immediate  enlistment,  and  at  the  time of my  entering upon  the duties of my office but comparatively few men had enlisted into these organizations. On  the  14th  of October,  1863,  the  call  for  three  hundred  thousand men was made  by  the President,  to  serve for  three  years,  and  authority was  given  for  the  payment  of  four  hundred  dollars  to  veterans  and  three  hundred dollars  to  new  recruits.   The  quota,  under  the  call,  assessed  to Vermont, was  three  thousand  three  hundred  and thirty men, and the period within which to raise the troops was limited to January 5, 1864. The work was at first very  greatly  retarded  from  the  difficulty  of  properly  adjusting  the  credits  due  and  belonging  to  the  several towns,  from  the  fact  that  towns,  as  sub-districts,  were  not  recognized  by  the  Government.  Efforts  were, however, promptly made, by application  to  the War Department,  to  remedy  the difficulty, and after some delay an order was obtained recognizing towns as sub-districts, and the quotas were accordingly assessed to the towns and  their credits properly adjusted. The quota of  the State was  then promptly filled within  the period  limited by the  call,  and  on  the  1st  day  of  February  following,  sixteen  hundred  and  twenty-one  enlisted  men  stood  to  the credit  of  the  State  as  a  surplus  over  all  calls  that  had  been  made.  This  surplus  continued  from  that  time constantly to augment, with slight variations, under the calls of February 14th and March 14th, so that, at the date of  the  last call by  the President,  July 14th,  the State had an entire  surplus of  two  thousand  two hundred and one men. Under this last call for five hundred thousand men, the quota of the State was five thousand one hundred and fifty-six.  Fifty days from the date of the call was the time allotted for filling the quota, and it is with a feeling of just  pride  that  I  congratulate  the  State  upon  the  promptitude  with  which  she  has  responded  to  it,  and  that  on settlement with  the General  government  to October  1st,  there was  found  to  be  due  to  the State  a  surplus  of  one thousand and fourteen men, which stands to her credit against any future call, should one hereafter be made. The report of the Adjutant and Inspector General, which will in due time be laid before you, will furnish you more  fully  in  detail  the  transactions  of  his  department.    It  is  but  justice  to  that  officer  to  say  that  the  State  is largely  indebted  to  him  for  the  energy  and  efficiency  displayed  in  the  details  of  his  department.    The  services rendered  by  him  have  been  of  great  value,  and  have  contributed  largely  in  securing  to  the  State  the  proud position which she this day enjoys. The  efforts which were made  throughout  the State  to  fill  the quotas under  the  first  call,  the  liberal  bounties paid by  the  towns generally, and  the fact  that under  this call new recruits received  three hundred dollars bounty from  the General Government, while  under  the  order  authorizing  the  raising  of  the  17th  and  18th  regiments  and the  3d  battery,  only  one  hundred  dollars  was  authorized,  all  conspired  to  retard  enlistment  in  these organizations,  and  the  question  was  seriously  entertained  of  disbanding  them  altogether.  Great  expense  had been  incurred  up  to  that  period  in  the  attempt  to  raise  the  men,  and  to  abandon  it  at  that  point  would  have involved  the State  in a very heavy burden.  I, however, did not  feel  justified  in attempting  further  to  fill  the 18th regiment, and accordingly directed the transfer of the men enlisted for that to the 17th regiment. Application was then  made  to  the  Secretary  of  War  for  authority  to  pay  new  recruits  for  this  regiment  Government  bounty  of three hundred dollars,  instead of one hundred. This  authority was  finally,  and  after  repeated  efforts, on  the 29th of  December,  granted.  Still  further  difficulties  were  experienced  at  this  time  by  the  withdrawal  of  the  town bounties.  The  embarrassments  thus  encountered  delayed  greatly  the  organization  of  the  17th  regiment.  The  3d battery was filled and mustered into the service of the United States on the 5th of January, 1864. On  the 18th of  last April seven companies of  the 17th regiment were sent  to  the field under  the command of Lieut.  Col.  Charles  Cummings.  On  the  19th  day  of  May  the  8th  company,  and  on  the  6th  day  of  July  the  9th company, were also sent to join the regiment. The 10th and last company has been fully organized, and is now at New Haven, Connecticut, waiting  to be ordered  forward. By  special arrangement with  the Secretary of War,  in this  regiment,  though  its  ranks  have  been  sadly  decimated  by  the  recent  severe  battles,  has  been  accepted  as  a complete organization, and authority has been granted to muster its colonel. The total amount of men furnished by the State, since the commencement of the war, is thirty-two thousand seven hundred and ten men—as follows:  782 For three months service,  4,833 For nine months service,  1,758 For one years service,  1 For two years service  25,336 For three years service,  ------------   32,710 The  total  number  in  service  on  the  1st  of  October,  as  near  as  can  be  ascertained  from  the  latest  returns,  is about twelve thousand two hundred and fifty. The  total  number  raised  since  October  1,  1863,  including  17th  regiment  and  3d  battery,  and  credits  not heretofore allowed, is 14,020.  The  State  has  thus  furnished  during  the  past  year  more  men  than  in  any  previous  year  since  the commencement  of  the  war.  And  the  promptitude  with  which  they  have  been  furnished  indicates  in  most unmistakable  language  the  determination  of  her  people  to  vindicate  the  power  of  the Government  in  this  great struggle, and to favor a vigorous prosecution of the war as the only sure means of establishing a peace that shall be alike honorable and enduring. AMENDMENT OF ENROLLMENT. Previous  to  the  call  of  the  President  for  five  hundred  thousand men  in  July  last,  orders  had  been  issued  by the War Department  to  the Acting Assistant  Provost Marshal General  of Vermont,  to  have  the  enrollment  lists in  the  several  towns  in  the State properly  revised  and  corrected up  to  July 1st,  1864.   Notices were  accordingly published  in  several  newspapers  in  the  State,  calling  upon  the  selectmen  to  see  that  the  enrollment  lists  were properly corrected. Upon the returns thus made the quotas of the several towns were assessed. Owing, however, either  to  the  fact  that  the notices did not reach all  the  towns, or  to a misunderstanding and neglect on  their part, great discrepancies were found to exist when the quotas were announced, and numerous applications were made to  the  Acting  Assistant  Provost  General  for  the  correction  of  these  errors  and  the  reductions  of  quotas.    A careful  examination  into  these  complaints  satisfied  that  officer  that  there  were  just  grounds  for  them,  and  that further  opportunity  should  be  given  for  correcting  the  lists.   Accordingly  on  the  24th  day  of August  notice was given    to  the  towns  to  correct  the  lists,  and  upon  returns  being  made,    it  was  ascertained  that  the  former enrollment was too large by nearly five thousand, and that consequently the State had been assessed nearly eight hundred  men  too  many.  A  new  assessment  of  quotas  was  therefore  ordered.    The  Acting  Assistant  Provost Marshal  General,  however,  did  not  feel  authorized  to  make  any  alteration  or  reduction  of  the  general  quota assessed  to  the  State  at  large,  or  to  the  several  congressional  districts.  Consequently  the  new  assessment  to towns  was  made  upon  the  amended  enrollment,  still  retaining  the  basis  of  the  old  assignment  of  quotas  to  the State  and  congressional  districts.  This  mode  of  assessment,  although  affording  relief  to  some  towns,  only increased  the  burden  to  others, without  relieving  the  real  point  of  difficulty.  It  became  necessary,  therefore,  to apply  to  the  War  Department  for  the  necessary  relief.  I  accordingly  made  application,  and  succeeded  in obtaining  not  only  the  proper  reduction  of  the  enrollment,  but  also  the  corresponding  reduction  of  the  quota  of the State, and authority    to apportion  this  to  the several  towns entitled  to  the same, so as  to equalize  the several congressional  districts.  The  number  thus  credited  was  seven  hundred  and  sixty-seven  men,  which  have  been properly  distributed  to  the  towns,  thus  giving  to  many  towns  who  had  already  promptly  furnished  their  full quotas,  a  large  excess  and  credit  to  apply  on  future  calls,  while  at  the  same  time  those  towns  which  were unjustly burdened by too excessive an assessment have been properly and justly relieved. The question of the expiration of the term of service of the recruits who enlisted into various regiments from this  State  in  the  summer  and  fall  of  1862,  has  been  an  exceedingly  delicate  and  troublesome  one,  both  to  the State  authorities  and  to  the  General  Government;  and  while  I  have  labored  earnestly  both  by  frequent correspondence  with  the War  Department,  and  by  personal  interviews,  to  secure  for  them  what  seemed  to  me but an act of justice, I am yet compelled to report my inability to accomplish any favorable result. A  simple narration of  the  facts will better convey  to your minds  the  true position of  affairs,  and  enable you to judge of your duties to these men under the peculiar circumstances in which they are placed In 1862  the Governor of Massachusetts obtained  from  the War Department a special order  for  that State,  to the effect that the term of service of all volunteers enlisting in regiments then in the field, would expire with that of  the  regiment  to  which  they  might  attach  themselves,  which  order  was  promulgated  in  the  usual  form  by publication  in  the  papers  of  the  day.  At  the  same  time  efforts  were  being  made  to  recruit  for  the  Vermont regiments,  and  the order  from Massachusetts being published  in  the  form of  a general order,  and  in papers  that were extensively read  in  this State,  inquiry was made of  the State authorities, both by officers recruiting and by the  recruits  themselves,  whether  the  term  of  service  of  such  as  might  enlist  in  the  Vermont  regiments  would expire with that of the regiment into which enlistments might be made. To this inquiry, reply, as I am informed, was uniformly made, that it would, and assurances were freely given in all cases where the question was raised, till  it  became  the  general  understanding  throughout  the  State.  Upon  the  strength  of  these,  coming  thus authoritatively, recruits enlisted freely and joined the regiments of their preference. My attention was first called to the subject by a memorial, signed by several of these recruits, who had been informed  unofficially  that  they  were  to  be  held  for  the  full  three  years’  service.  The  enlistment  contracts  and muster  rolls,  signed  by  the  recruits,  were  for  the  period  of  three  years,  but  these  were  at  the  time  regarded  as mere form, the assurances given being most prominent in the minds of the recruit, and being wholly relied upon by them. The faith of the State thus became strongly pledged to these men, and they had the right to believe that the pledge would be preserved inviolate. In  May  last  I  first  called  the  attention  of  the  President  and  Secretary  of  War,  to  the  subject,  and  they informed me  that no authority had ever been granted  to  this State  for  such assurances as were given, and while they  deeply  regretted  the  disappointment  to  these  recruits,  and  would  cheerfully  grant  the  request  for  their discharge  with  the  several  regiments  to  which  they  were  attached,  if  it  could  consistently  be  done,  yet  that regard  for  the public safety compelled  them  to deny  the  request. That  the same question existed  in other States, and to grant the request in one instance would settle the principle as to all, and great injury would consequently result  to  the  service,  just  at  the  critical  period  of  an  important  and  active  campaign.  Subsequent  applications have  resulted  in a similar manner. The disappointment  to  the  recruits  in many  instances  is very great, and yet,  I am  proud  to  say,  that,  so  far  as  has  come  to  my  knowledge,  these  soldiers  have  borne  their  disappointment manfully, and have performed all the duties assigned them with a cheerfulness and alacrity that speaks loudly in their praise. I  would  respectfully  submit  for  your  consideration  whether  it  might  not  be  well  to  place  these  recruits  for the remainder of their term on the footing of re-enlisted men, and, if anything should be done for these latter, in the  form  of  a  bounty  from  the  State,  that  these  recruits  should  also,  under  these  circumstances,  be  considered, and  receive  the  same  or  a  proportionate  bounty.  These  recruits  embrace  those  who  enlisted  in  1862  into  the regiments and organizations then in the service, and companies L and M of the 1st Vermont Cavalry. STATE MILITIA AND MILITIA LAW. In  my  last  communication  I  took  occasion  to  direct  your  attention  briefly  to  the  subject  of  adopting  an efficient  and  active  militia  system.  The  events  of  the  past  year  and  the  present  threatening  aspect  of  affairs, render  it  especially  proper  that  I  should  again  and  more  earnestly,  invite  you  to  a  serious  consideration  of  the subject. Vermont  stands  to-day  utterly  destitute  of  any  arm  of  defense  or  any  efficient  power  to  resist  or  to  prevent invasion. The  dangers  to  our  northern  frontier  are  by  no means  inconsiderable,  nor  can  I with  a  just  regard  for the  welfare  of  the  State  overlook  them;  nor,  in  the  light  of  the  evidence  now  in  my  possession,  can  I  justify myself  in  withholding  an  urgent  appeal  to  the  Legislature  to  frame  such  law  as  will  place  the  State  in  that position of  security, and afford  those means of protection  to her people, without which  they are  left exposed  to the most wanton  and high handed predatory  incursions. A prudent  regard  for  the public  interest does not  admit of my communicating,  in  this  form, all  the  facts  in my possession  tending  to show  the actual dangers  to which, during  the past year,  the State has been  exposed.  It  is  sufficient  for me  to  say  that  such  evidence,  coming  from authoritative  sources, was placed  in my possession as  satisfied me  that  the peace and  safety of our border were seriously threatened, and to lead to the adoption of proper measures to prevent disasters which would have been most  serious  in  their  consequences  to  the  entire  community.    Nor  are  the  dangers  by  any  means  altogether averted.  The more  recent movements  upon  the western  lakes  and  along  the  northern  frontier  are  but  evidences of thoroughly organized plans, limited by no means to those special localities, but extending to the whole line of our  frontier,  manifesting  themselves  now  upon  the  more  easterly  portion  and  now  at  other  and  more  remote points  along  the  western  border,  but  all  partaking  of  the  same  general  purpose,  and  bearing  unmistakable evidence of being controlled and actuated by one master mind. I am not unmindful of the sentiment that has hitherto so extensively pervaded the minds of the people of the State,  in  regard  to  organizing  the militia;  and  the  arguments  that  have  been  urged  against  such  a measure  have appealed  to  my  own  mind  heretofore  with  controlling  force.  The  burdens  already  resting  upon  the  State  are large.  The  young men who would  have  been  relied  upon  to  bear  the most  prominent  part  in  such  organization have been drawn from us to engage in the active service of the country; the enterprises of the State have thus to a  great  extent  been  made  to  suffer,  and  heavier  burdens  are  in  consequence  thus  imposed  upon  those  who  are left at home. These  and  kindred  arguments  have  weighed  with  me  hitherto  with  great  force,  and  I  have  been  not altogether  free  from  doubt  as  to  the  expediency  of  attempting  such  an  organization  at  the  present  time.  I  have, however, become fully satisfied that a just regard to the safety of our commonwealth demands now at the hands of the Legislature an immediate and vigorous preparation for defence. If  there  were  ever  a  time  when  our  safety  depended  upon  our  vigilance,  when  a  well  ordered  and  efficient militia would prove  a bulwark  to preserve our peace,  and  a  “basis of defence”  against  threatened  invasion,  and perhaps the only means of averting it, that time has, in my deliberate judgment, fully arrived. Feeling thus the importance of the militia, and with a view to relieve the State, so far as is practicable, of the great and principal source of expense attending such an organization, I made application to the Secretary of War for a sufficient quantity of arms, accoutrements and ordnance stores to arm and equip the militia of this State to the extent of fifteen  thousand muskets,  in  the event of an organization of  the militia by  the Legislature. In reply the  Secretary  of  War  has  signified  his  willingness  to  furnish  the  amount  required.    The  State  will  thus  be relieved  of  the  great  and  principal  item  of  expense;  and  that  which  has  hitherto  been  used  as  a  most  potent argument  against  an  organization,  is  now  removed.  I  also  received  personal  assurances  from  the  Secretary  that camp  equipments  such  as might  be  required  for  drill  and  instruction  in  camp would  be  freely  furnished  by  the department to the extent needed, on the proper requisition.  I  transmit  with  this  the  correspondence  with  the  Secretary  of  War  on  this  subject,  to  which  I  would respectfully call your attention. I  would  therefor  respectfully  recommend  the  passage  of  an  act  providing  for  an  immediate  and  proper enrollment  of  all  the  arms-bearing  population  of  the  State,  with  proper  provisions  for  examinations  and exemptions; from the number thus enrolled. Such number of regiments, brigades, and divisions to be organized, armed  and  equipped,  as  in  your  better  judgment may  be  thought  expedient,  and  suitable  provision  to  be made for necessary drill and  instruction  in military duty, and  for calling out  the militia as occasion may  require, with power  to  the Executive  of  the State  to  draft  from  the  enrolled militia  to  fill  up  from  time  to  time  the  regiments organized, or if necessary to organize new ones. Upon  the  proper  details  of  such  an  organization  you  will  be  best  able  to  judge,  and  I  commit  the  whole subject  to  your  careful  consideration,  trusting  that  you will  be  led  to  such  favorable  results,  and  perfect  such  a system  as will be  simple  and  efficient,  and  at  the  same  time  secure  to  the State  that  sure and ample measure of protection  from  foreign  aggression  which  can  be  best  found,  in  the  form  best  adapted  to  our  free  institutions, only in a well trained and thoroughly-disciplined, patriotic citizen soldiery, “ever present, rarely seen, quartered among  us,  not  in  camps  and  forts,  but  at  the  fireside,  in  the  counting-room,  the  workshop,  the  place  of business,” ready with stout hearts and trained hands to defend our firesides and our homes from the aggressions of a foreign foe, or from the more ruthless attacks of bold marauders, instigated and led on by domestic traitors. HOSPITALS. In  obedience  to  the  joint  resolution  of  the  two  houses  authorizing  and  requesting  the  Governor  to  provide further  and  ample  accommodations  for  the  sick  and  wounded  Vermont  soldiers,  I  proceeded  at  once  to  make such  provisions  as  the  interests  of  the  State  and  the  exigencies  of  the  service  seemed  to  require.  Instructions were given to the acting Surgeon General of the State, Dr. S. W. Thayer, to make provision for the enlargement of  the hospital at Burlington  to  the extent of  two hundred beds and also  to examine and  report  the best  location for  the  erection  of  hospital  buildings,  regard  being  had  to  the  best  accommodation  of  all  parts  of  the  State.  In obedience  to  the  instructions  given,  the  acting  Surgeon  General  made  the  proper  examinations,  and  submitted his report, recommending Montpelier as the best and most desirable location, all things considered, and that the necessary buildings  for  the accommodation of  three or  four hundred patients be erected, as soon as practicable, provide  the  location  should  meet  the  approval  of  the  Medical  Director  of  the  Department  of  the  East.  The Medical  Director  in  a  personal  interview  approved  the  location  and  the  report  of  the  Surgeon  General  of  the State was subsequently submitted to him, and received his cordial approbation. The report and letter of approval 933 2412  are  herewith  transmitted.  Preparations  were  accordingly  made  for  the  erection  of  the  necessary  buildings,  and the work was placed in charge of the Quartermaster General of the State. In the early part of June last the buildings were partially completed, and accommodations prepared for about three hundred beds. The  reports  from  the  several  hospitals  show  that  an  aggregate  of  four  thousand  two  hundred  and  sixteen patients have been received during the past year, as follows: At the United States General hospital a Brattleboro, since  October 1, 1863,  At the Baxter United States General hospital at Burlington,  since October 1, 1863,  At the Sloan United States General Hospital at Montpelier, since the completion of the Hospital in June,  871 The same reports show remaining in Hospitals, October 1st, 1864, an aggregate of thirteen hundred and four, as follows: 487 United States General Hospital, Brattleboro,  338 Baxter United States General Hospital, Burlington,  479 Sloan United States General Hospital, Montpelier, -------   1304 The  large  number  of  wounded  in  the  recent  battles  will  soon  increase  this  number,  and  added  to  this  the usual  proportion  of  sick  among  the  new  levies  who  have  just  gone  to  the  field,  the  hospital  accommodations will soon now be found too limited. The  amount  expended  in  enlarging  the  hospital  at  Burlington  has  been  assumed  and  paid  by  the  General Government,  and  that  amount  does  not  appear  in  the  accounts  of  the  State.  The  Treasurer  of  the  State  has advanced,  by  my  direction,  for  the  hospital  at  Montpelier,  the  amount  of  thirty-two  thousand  five  hundred dollars. Other buildings are now  in process of construction, consisting of a chapel and barracks  for  the Veteran Reserve  Corps.  The  work  has  been  under  the  supervision  of  the  Quartermaster  General  of  the  State,  and  all vouchers and details of expenditures will be found in his accounts. In  May  last,  arrangements  were  made  with  the  War  Department  to  occupy  the  hospital  so  far  as  finished, and to supply the necessary furniture. Notwithstanding the large increase of hospital accomodations, there is not yet sufficient  in  the State  to supply  the demand, and many soldiers are still  left  in distant hospitals unable  to be transferred to Vermont for want of room. No  State  has  made  more  liberal  provisions  for  its  soldiers  than  Vermont,  and  I  am  happy  thus  to congratulate the State on the position which she occupies in this respect. Whether it would be advisable to make still further provision  to  increase  the accomodations,  is a question  left  to your careful consideration. The matter of expense to any reasonable amount is unworthy of consideration, in comparison with the welfare and comfort of the men who thus nobly offered their lives to their country. GETTYSBURG CEMETERY. Soon  after  the memorable  battle  at Gettysburg  in  July,  1863,  the  plan  for  locating  a  place  for  the  interment of the remains of the heroes who fell there in defense of the Union, was originated. In pursuance of this design, arrangements  were  made  by  the  Governor  of  Pennsylvania  for  the  purchase  of  the  land  necessary  for  the purpose, and with a view to make it national in its character, correspondence was opened with the Governors of the loyal States having soldiers lying on the battle-field, and their co-operation invited.  Arrangements were  also  completed  for  repairing  and  beautifying  the  grounds  and  for  gathering  in  from  the rude graves, where they were temporarily buried, the brave and gallant dead of the different States, and interring them in lots set apart to each State. To secure for Vermont a suitable lot, and the more carefully to superintend the disinterment and reinterment of  the  fallen  soldiers  from  this State, on  the 23rd of October  last  I appointed Col. W. G. Veazey agent  in behalf of  the  State, with  instructions  to  proceed  immediately  to Gettysburg  to  discharge  the  duties  assigned  him.  The report of Col. Veazey is herewith transmitted for your information. The  cemetery  grounds were  formally  dedicated with  appropriate  ceremonies  on  the  29th  day  of November, 1863.   The  title  to  the  grounds  is  vested  in  the State  of Pennsylvania  “in  trust  for  all  the States  having  soldiers buried in said grounds.” The  total number buried  in  the cemetery  from all  the States,  is  three  thousand  five hundred and  twelve, and the  number  from  this  State  is  sixty-one. Great  care  has  been  taken  to  ascertain  and  preserve  the  identity  of  the bodies, and  they now rest  in  the new cemetery grounds, near  the spot where  they fell, surrounded by all  that art and love can do to adorn their final resting place, hallowed by the memories of that great struggle for liberty and humanity, to which they consecrated themselves, and in which they so freely yielded up their lives. Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  act  of  incorporation,  I  appointed Hon.  Paul Dillingham  commissioner  for the State of Vermont. The  total  cost  of  completing  the  cemetery  is  estimated  to  be  six  thousand  five  hundred  dollars,  and  the several  States  interested  in  the  enterprise  are  called  upon  to  appropriate  their  proportion  to  this  amount,  to  be divided  on  the  basis  of  the  representation  of  the  several  States  in  the  Congress  of  the  United  States.  The proportion  of  Vermont  will  be  about  twelve  hundred  and  sixty  dollars.  An  order  for  one-fourth  of  this  sum, three  hundred  and  fifteen  dollars  as  the  first  installment,  was  drawn  upon  the  State,  but  there  being  no appropriation  specifically  made  for  this  purpose,  the  order  could  not  be  accepted.    Strong  assurances  were, however, given  by  the  commissioner, Lieutenant Governor Dillingham,  that  the necessary  appropriation would be made at the present session of the Legislature.  I would, therefore respectfully recommend that appropriation be  made  of  a  sum  sufficient  to  pay  the  proportion  of  these  expenses  that  may  be  due  from  Vermont,  and empowering  the  Governor  of  the  State  from  time  to  time  to  appoint  commissioners  under  the  act  of incorporation. I herewith transmit the report of Hon. Paul Dillingham in reference to the subject. BOUNTIES TO RE-ENLISTED SOLDIERS. I would most  respectfully call your attention  to  the propriety of providing  for  the payment of  some  suitable bounty to the veteran soldiers who have re-enlisted for another period of three years. It is but an act of justice to these  gallant  soldiers  that  they  should  receive  some  fitting  recognition  of  their  devotion,  and  this  new  act  of consecration to the service of the country. The  State  and  several  towns  entitled  to  them  have  been  credited  with  these  re-enlistments,  and  have  thus been  enabled  to  fill  their  quotas  to  that  extent  with  veteran  soldiers.  Upon  the  return  of  these  veterans  on  the promised  furlough,  they  confidently  expected,  as  I  have  reason  to  believe,  that  they  would  participate  in  the bounties which were  being  so  liberally  offered  by  the  towns  for  recruits.  In  this, with  but  few  exceptions,  they were disappointed, and were compelled to submit  to  the manifest  injustice of seeing  the  liberal bounties paid  to men in experienced in the service, while they, war-worn and veteran, having originally responded to the calls of their  country  without  reward,  and  having  by  their  gallantry  won  for  the  State  an  imperishable  and  glorious record, were  obliged  to  return  to  their  service  unrequited.  I would,  therefore,  recommend  the  passage  of  an  act authorizing  the  payment  of  a  suitable  bounty  to  all  these  re-enlisted  men  who  have  not  already  received  a bounty from the towns to which they are credited. TOWN BOUNTIES. The  subject  of  the  payment  of  bounties  by  the  towns  demands  a  careful  consideration  at  your  hands. Some sound  and  judicious  legislation  is  required  in  order  to  check  the  evil  tendencies  of  the  present  system,  and  to prevent  the  excessive  extravagance  and  inequalities  which  are  working  so  much  mischief  and  injustice  in  the State. A proper  regard  to  the public  interest,  in my view,  requires  that  these bounties  should be kept within  the control of the State, as in this way only can a uniform system be secured. It is also a subject for you to consider whether  the  bounties  thus  far  paid  by  the  towns  shall,  upon  some  equitable  basis,  be  assumed  by  the  State.  I allude  to  the  subject,  however,  at  this  time,  not  designing  to  make  any  recommendation,  but  simply  to  direct your attention to it, leaving it to your better judgment to dispose of. LAW AUTHORIZING THE GOVERNOR TO SUMMON THE JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT TO HIS COUNSEL WHEN NECESSARY There is no law at present existing by which the Executive is empowered to call upon the Supreme Court of the  State  for  an  opinion  in  cases  affecting  the  interests  of  the  State,  and  involving  important  legal  questions. Such cases are not of unfrequent occurrence, and the responsibilities thus devolved upon the Executive are very great,  and  oftentimes  extremely  embarrassing.  Similar  provision  is made  by  law  in  other  states,  and  it  is made the duties of the Judges of the Supreme Court to render opinions when called upon by the Executive, in all cases affecting  the  general  interests of  the  commonwealth. Such  a  law,  I doubt not, would be very  salutary here,  and especially  in  the  present  state  of  affairs,  and  the  interests  of  the  State  thereby  greatly  promoted.  I  would, therefore,  respectfully  suggest  that  a  law  be  passed  making  it  the  duty  of  one  or  more  of  the  Judges  of  the Supreme Court, whenever called upon  to do  so by  the Governor of  the State,  to  render an opinion,  in writing  if necessary, upon such questions as may be submitted to them affecting the general interests of the State.  LAW PROVIDING FOR SOLDIERS VOTING. The law passed at your last session providing for soldiers voting contained a provision that the “act shall not take  effect  until  the  Governor  submit  the  same  to  the  Judges  of  the  Supreme  Court,  with  the  inquiry,  Are  the provisions  of  this  act  constitutional?  and  until  the Governor  has  obtained  in writing  the  opinion  of  said  Judges thereon;  and  if  said  Judges  decide  that  the  provisions  of  the  act,  or  certain  parts  thereof;  are  unconstitutional, then  the same, or such parts  thereof as said Judges shall decide are unconstitutional, shall be null and void, and the residue shall remain in full force and virtue.” In  pursuance  of  this  provision  I  submitted  the  act  to  the  Judges  of  the  Supreme  Court  with  the  inquiry specified.  The  Judges  of  the  Supreme  Court  replied  to  the  inquiry,  giving  a  full  and  unanimous  opinion  in writing,  deciding  the  act  so  far  as  it  relates  to  the  right  of  the  soldiers  to  vote  for  members  of  Congress  and Electors  of President  and Vice President  of  the United States,  to  be  constitutional,  but  that  so much  of  said  act as confers the right to vote for Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Treasurer of this State, was unconstitutional. So much of said act therefore as relates to the right of soldiers to vote for members of Congress and Electors of President  and Vice President of  the United States was declared  to be  in  full  force  and virtue  I  therefore  caused to be prepared suitable and proper blanks and forms for making the necessary returns to the proper officers, and forwarded  to  the several organizations  in  the  field  from  this State n season  for  the soldiers  to vote  for members of Congress at the regular election for those officers. There  are  some  amendments  to  the  law  which  should  receive  your  immediate  attention.  The  law  now provides that at the election for electors, to be held on the first Tuesday of November, each elector authorized to vote  by  this  act  shall  have  the  right  to  vote  for  Electors.  The  election  for  Electors  is  by  law  to  be  held  on  the Tuesday next after the first Monday of November, instead of the first Tuesday. This error should be corrected to conform  to  the  proper  day.  Section  eleventh  of  the  act  provides  that  “the  Secretary  of  State  shall  return  said votes to the General Assembly, to be canvassed the same as provided in reference to votes for the same officers cast in this State.’’ By the laws of this State the County Clerks “shall meet at the State House, in Montpelier, on the  third Tuesday of  said November,  and  there  publicly  canvass  said  votes.” The  law  should be  so  amended  as to  provide  that  the  Secretary  of  State  shall  return  the  votes  for  electors  to  the  Board  of  Canvassers  when assembled. Provision should also be made for qualifying the electors. According to the present provisions of the act,  only  qualified  electors  are  permitted  to  vote.  As  there  are  many  now  in  the  military  service  of  the  United States  from  this  State, who  have,  since  entering  the  service,  arrived  at  legal  age,  they  should  be  entitled  to  the privileges  of  the  act;  and  provision  should  be  made  giving  authority  to  special  constables  to  administer  the necessary  oaths.  Provision  should  also  be  made  giving  to  volunteer  officers  having  commissions  from  the United  States  authorities,  who  are  citizen  of  this  State,  the  right  to  vote  at  the  polls  of  any  company  from  this State in the brigade, division or corps to which they may be attached. I  would  therefore  recommend  that  the  act  be  amended  in  these  respects  at  an  early  day,  that  proper instructions and blanks may be forwarded to the field in season for the approaching election.  I herewith transmit the opinion of the Judges of the Supreme Court upon the question of the constitutionality of the law. LAND SCRIP. The agent appointed under the act providing for the sale of the land scrip approved November 11, 1863, has effected  a  sale  of  the  same.    The  proceeds  of  said  sale  amount  to  the  sum  of  one  hundred  and  twenty-six thousand  two  hundred  and  forty-one  dollars  and  forty  cents, which  has  been  duly  invested  in  the  bonds  of  this State  at  par.  In October  last  the Hon. Homer E. Royce,  one  of  the  agents  appointed  under  the  act,  resigned  the trust. I appointed Henry W. Hickok, Esq., of Burlington, to fill the vacancy. VERMONT STATE UNIVERSITY AND ASSOCIATE COLLEGES. The act incorporating the Vermont State University, and appropriating the income arising from the proceeds of the scrip for public lands, approved November 11, 1863, provides for the union and incorporation of the three existing  corporations  in  this  State—the  President  and  Fellows  of  Middlebury  College,  the  University  of Vermont, and Norwich University—or either one of them, with the corporation created by the act aforesaid, and for the transfer and conveyance of all their property both real and personal to the State University. It  was  strongly  hoped  that  this  act  would  have  secured  to  the  State  and  to  the  cause  of  education  the  full beneficial results of a union of all the present colleges, and the formation of one institution, uniting the strength and  resources  of  all,  and  realizing  the  true  idea  of  a  State  University,  managed  and  controlled  by  no  sect  or denomination, but established and maintained upon a broad and liberal basis, that should secure to the State that strength of position in all her educational interests which such an institution properly conducted alone can give. Efforts  have  been made  during  the  past  year  to  secure  such  an  union  and  incorporation  of  the  several  colleges, but  the  difficulties which  necessarily  attend  such  an  enterprise  before  harmony  of  action  can  be  secured  and  a proper basis determined, have thus far prevented. The  University  of  Vermont  has,  however,  elected  to  become  united  and  incorporated  with  the  State University,  and  have  elected  seven  persons  of  their  number  to  become members  of  the  corporation  created  by the act aforesaid, and have transferred by their vote all the property of the University, together with the rights to the  rents  and  uses  of  the  lands  belonging  to  them,  and  have  left  for  record  and  caused  to  be  recorded  in  the office of  the Secretary of State,  in  the book of  records a  true and attested copy of  the  record of  the proceedings of  the  meetings  of  their  board,  duly  certified  by  their  secretary,  in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  act aforesaid.  By  this  act  of  union  the  corporation  of  the  Vermont  State  University  becomes,  on  the  first  of November  proximo,  valid  and  legal,  under  and  by  virtue  of  said  act  of  incorporation.  To  a  partial  extent, therefore,  has  been  realized  the  plan  of  a  State  institution;  into  which  shall  be  incorporated  the  elements contemplated by  the act of Congress, namely,  instruction such branches of  learning as are  related  to agriculture and  the  mechanic  arts,  not  excluding  other  scientific  and  classical  studies,  in  such  manner  as  to  promote  the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life. It  is  to be hoped  that  the union of  all  the  colleges will yet be  effected  the  sentiment of  the State, which has so  strongly  favored  such  an union,  and which has  increased  in proportion  as  the  subject has been  agitated, will yet  find  its  realization  in  an  institution  strongly  established  on  the  broad  basis  of  a  university  in  its  true  idea, sustained and patronized by  the people, and contributing by  its power and  influence  to  the great and paramount interests of education, until Vermont, now occupying a distinguished position for her devotion to the great cause of liberty, shall stand second to none in her institutions for the education of her people. Time  and  a  patient  effort  on  the  part  of  the  friends  of  education  can  alone  secure  this  end,  and  it  is  to  be most  earnest  hoped  that  this  effort  will  not  be  relaxed.  The  order  still  to  give  opportunity  for  the accomplishment  of  an  end  so  desirable,  I  would  suggest  the  propriety  of  extending  the  time  limited  in  the  act incorporating the Vermont State University, so that, within any reasonable time in the future, either one or both the other institutions in the State may become united with this, if they shall so elect. NATIONAL HALL FOR STATUARY. By  a  joint  resolution  of  the  two  houses  of  Congress  at  the  last  session,  the  old  hall  of  the  house  of Representatives was  set apart as a hall  for  statuary,  to be  filled by  the  statues of  the worthies  from each and all the states. The record which Vermont has made in the present struggle, as well as her past historic fame, renders it eminently fit and proper that she should be represented in the collection that will be gathered there, by a statue of  some of her worthy heroes. Possessing  in  rich abundance and of a quality unsurpassed  the marble  for such a work,  and  counting  among  her  sons  some  of  the  best  sculptors  of  modern  times,  from  no  other  state  could  a work  be  produced  that would  combine  so much  of  interest,  and  be  so  eminently  representative  in  its  character, as Vermont. I commend the subject to your favorable consideration. STATE AUDITOR. The  office  of  Auditor  of  Accounts  became  vacant  in  June  last  by  the  death  of  Hon.  Jeptha  Bradley.    I appointed Hon. Dugald Stewart, of Middlebury,  to  fill  the vacancy.   The proper bonds were duly  executed  and filed, and the books and papers of that department were duly passed over to him. SURGEON GENERAL In  October  last  I  appointed  Samuel W.  Thayer,  M.D.,  of  Burlington,  acting  Surgeon  General  of  the  State. Though there exists no law recognizing such an office, I felt that the interests of the State, and the welfare of the soldiers, would be greatly promoted if there were some distinct department of that kind established, whose duty it would be  to  look  carefully  after  the  sanitary  condition of  the  soldiers  in  the  field  and  in  the hospitals,  and  an officer  appointed  who,  from  his  professional  experience,  would  be  able  to  make  from  time  to  time  such suggestions, and recommend such plans, as would conduce to their comfort and welfare. In  these respects I have derived great assistance during  the past year from  the ready and active co-operation of the acting Surgeon General. In May last, at the opening of the summer campaign, when our soldiers suffered so  severely  in  those memorable  battles,  I was  enabled,  through  the  efficient  preparation which  had  been made by  him,  to  forward  a  corps  of  surgeons  directly  to  the  field,  where  their  services  were  greatly  needed  in administering to the wants and alleviating the sufferings of our wounded. I would  therefore  recommend  that  an  act  be  passed  establishing  such  an  office,  to  be  filled  by  appointment by  the Governor,  and  to  be  attached  to  his  staff with  the  rank  of  brigadier  general,  and  that  provision  be made for a reasonable per diem compensation for actual services, and for the payment of his expenses. ARMS FOR THE STATE. In  compliance with  the  joint  resolution of  the  two Houses,  adopted  at  the  last  session,  that  the Governor be requested  to  solicit  from  the General Government  five  thousand  stand  of  arms,  to  be  deposited  and  kept  in  the arsenal  of  the  United  States  within  this  State,  subject  to  the  order  of  the  Governor,  in  case  of  invasions, insurrection  or  domestic  violence,  I  made  application  to  the  Secretary  of  War,  and  obtained  from  him  five thousand  Springfield  rifled  muskets,  with  the  necessary  accoutrements  and  ordnance  stores,  which  are  now deposited in the United States arsenal at Vergennes. ENLISTMENTS IN REBEL STATES. By  the provisions of  the act of Congress approved July 4, 1864,  the Executive of each State was authorized to  send  recruiting  agents  into  any  of  the  States  declared  to  be  in  rebellion,  except  the  States  of  Arkansas, Tennessee and Louisiana, to recruit volunteers under any call, under the provisions of said act.  In  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  said  law,  I  issued  the  necessary  orders,  and  appointed  recruiting officers  for  the  several  stations  authorized  by  the  orders  of  the War  Department.  Authority  was  given  to  such towns  as desired  to  avail  themselves of  the benefits of  the  act,  to deposit with  the Treasurer of  the State,  to  the credit  of  the Adjutant  and  Inspector General,  the  sum  of  three  hundred  dollars  for  each  recruit  desired  by  such town,  not,  however  exceeding  forty  per  cent.  of  the whole number needed  to be  raised  to  fill  the quota of  such town  under  the  then  existing  call  of  the President;  the  amount  so  deposited  to  be  used  for  the  payment  of  such bounties,  and  such  necessary  expenses  incident  thereto,  as  might  be  required  to  raise  the  men;  the  recruits  so obtained  to  be mustered  into  the United  States  service  to  the  general  credit  of  the  State  of Vermont,  and  to  be afterwards  assigned  to  the  credits  of  the  several  towns  making  such  deposits,  in  proportion  to  the  number  of recruits  for  which  each  town  should  have  made  such  deposit.  Such  sum  of  money  as  should  remain  in  the Treasury, to be refunded to the several towns after final adjustment. Twelve  recruiting agents were appointed under  this order, and were  stationed as  follows: Two at Nashville, Tenn.,  for  the  district  of  Georgia  and  Alabama;  two  at  Hilton  Head,  for  the  district  of  South  Carolina  and Florida; two at Alexandira, for the district of North Eastern Virginia three at Fortress Monroe, for the district of South Eastern Virginia three at Fortress Monroe, for the district of North Carolina. The number of towns which deposited money for obtaining recruits was one hundred and forty. The whole number of recruits obtained from this  source was  one  hundred  and  twenty-four, who  have  been  properly  distributed  among  the  towns  entitled  to them. The  details  of  the  distribution,  the  expenses  attending  enlistments,  and  the  amount  of  bounties  paid, will more fully appear in the report of the Adjutant and Inspector General. ENLISTMENTS FOR SERVICE WITHOUT THIS STATE. I would respectfully call your attention to the present statute in reference to enlisting persons in this State for military service without this State. Great difficulties have been experienced heretofore and especially during the past  year,  from  persons  procuring  enlistments  of  recruits  in  this  State  to  serve  in  other  States,  and  the  present law  is  wholly  inadequate  to  prevent  the  evil.  The  difficulties  in  the  way  of  finding  the  necessary  evidence  to convict, and  the  small  fine  imposed,  render  it an easy matter,  for  the offender  to  repeat  the offense almost with impunity; and in some instances, where a conviction has been had, the fine, though imposed to the full extent of the law, has been promptly paid, and the offense repeated almost in the face of the court who imposed it. At the high rates which have been paid abroad, as well as here in our own State, for recruits, it is an easy matter to pay the  fine  imposed, and  still  leave  to  the party obtaining  the  recruit a  large margin  for profit, while  the victims  to this  abuse  have  been  led  away  from  their  duties  to  their  own  State,  to  find  too  late  that  they  have  been  most shamefully deceived and imposed upon. In  addition  to  this,  the  practice  which  has  obtained  to  so  large  an  extent  here  in  the  State  of  trafficing  in substitutes  and  recruits,  has  operated  very  prejudicially  to  the  service,  and  with  all  the  efforts  of  the  State authorities,  seconded  by  the  officers  of  the United  States within  the  State,  it  has  been  found  almost  impossible to reach the difficulty and prevent the traffic. I  would  invite  your  serious  attention  to  the  subject,  and  recommend  such  amendments  of  the  present  law, providing  the  most  stringent  and  summary  remedies,  as  will  not  only  effectually  prohibit  the  attempt  to  enlist men for other States, but also put an end to the system of “substitute brokerage” at home. INSPECTOR OF FINANCE. Under  the  law  requiring  the Governor  annually  to  appoint  an  Inspector  of  Finance,  to  assist  the Auditor  of Accounts  in  his  annual  examination  of  the Treasurer’s  department  and  to  examine  the  books  and  papers  in  the Auditor’s department,  I  appointed Evelyn Pierpoint, Esq., of Rutland, who duly  accepted  the  appointment,  and entered upon the duties of the office. THE SOLDIERS. Fresh  in  the memory  of  us  all  are  the  deeds  of  noble  valor  and  undaunted  heroism  achieved  by  the  gallant sons  of  Vermont  during  the  past  year.  History  furnishes  no  brighter  record  than  theirs.  In  every  conflict,  on every battle-field, ever and always the invincible heroes of the Green Mountain State. Their thinned and wasted ranks  speak  in  language  stronger  than words,  of  their  daring  bravery,  their  undying  devotion,  and  their  fervent patriotism;  and,  in  after years, when  the  glittering pomp  and  circumstance of war  shall  have  become mellowed into sober history,  the memory of  their high achievements will still remain fresh as now  in  the hearts of all  true patriots,  and  their names will be  treasured  as household words,  and be  rehearsed  to generations yet  to  come,  to kindle anew in their hearts the sentiment of loyalty and patriotism. To  those  still  engaged  in  the  deadly  strife would we  this  day  speak  in words  of  encouragement  and  praise. To them does the Nation look with confidence and hope for its deliverence from the foe that seeks to destroy it. To them are turned the waiting eyes of millions of bondsmen, with trustful faith for deliverance from the power of the oppressor. For the fallen!  In our hearts do we mourn for them, and yet not altogether in sadness. Theirs was a glorious death.    They  died  as  the  patriot  loves  to  die,  martyrs  in  the  glorious  cause  of  their  country;  and  though  their forms  lie  whitening  on  a  stranger  soil,  yet  they  live  still  in  the  hearts  of  their  countrymen,  crowned  with  an imperishable fame—  “These shall resist the empire of decay,  When time is o’er, and worlds have passed away;  Cold in the dust the perished heart may lie,  But that which warmed it once can never die.”  THE STATE AND COUNTRY. Once  more  has  Vermont  uttered,  in  language  not  to  be  mistaken,  her  devotion  to  the  great  and  cardinal principles of “Freedom and Unity.”  in  the great struggle  in which  the nation  is now convulsed, she has pursued no  doubtful  or  hesitating  course,  but  has  steadily  devoted  herself  with  all  the  strength  of  her  resource,  to  the great  and  paramount  idea  of  sustaining  its  integrity.  Freely  has  she  offered  her  sons,  and  with  unsparing  hand has she given of her substance, and now in the great crisis, when the returning season for the election of a Chief Magistrate to preside over the councils of the nation enters to disturb the already distracted state of the country, when upon  the  issues of  this  contest hang  the  last hopes of  rebels  in  arms,  and  their  sympathizers  at home,  she proudly leads the van, and sounds the key note in the great and glorious anthem of the Union. The  signal  victories  of  our  armies  have  inspired  the  country  with  new  and  increasing  confidence,  and  the ever narrowing circle of  the conflict assures us beyond a doubt  that  the end  is drawing near, and  that  the power of  the  rebellion  is  fast  being  broken. This day our hearts  are doubly  cheered by  tidings  of  renewed  expressions of  loyalty,  as  state  after  state  declares  its  unalterable  determination  to  vindicate  the  power  of  Government,  to accept  no  terms  of  dishonorable  peace,  but  to  fight  on  till  the  last  vestige  of  treason  shall  be  removed,  and  all the states shall return to their rightful allegiance. Gentlemen  of  the  senate  and  base  of  Representatives,  to  you  are  now  committed  the  sacred  trusts  of  the constitution.  In  the hope  that your  labors will be characterized by  that spirit of harmony and sound deliberation so essential to wise and prudent legislation, I commend you to the guidance and direction of Him who rules the destinies of nations,  imploring you  to  seek His  counsel  at  all  times,  and  to  so  legislate  that  the Commonwealth may be advanced in all her material interests, and that as one of the great sisterhood of states, Vermont may still maintain her high position, and be made to contribute for the future, as she has in time past, to the extent of her resources, to the maintenance of the Government under which we have so long lived and prospered.  Montpelier, Oct. 13, 1864.  } EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, J. GREGORY SMITH.
