Inaugural address of  Thomas P. Salmon  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1975 Friday, January 10, 1975. Inaugural Address  Thank  you  Mr.  President,  Mr.  Speaker,  Chief  Justice,  Members  of  the  Supreme  Court,  Reverend Clergy,  Governor  Aiken,  Governor  Stafford,  Governor  Hoff,  Mrs.  Arthur,  Members  of  this  General Assembly and friends. Thirty-eight years ago this very week, another man stood at the rostrum where I stand today and closed his address with these words: “While  I  occupy  the  executive  office  it  will  not  be  the  office  of  any  particular  group  or  sect,  and  I selfishly  hope  that  at  the  end  of my  term  it may  be  said  that my  administration was  a  successful  one. With your  help  it  will  be.  Let  us  forget  our  political  differences,  forget  that  we may  not  attend  the  same  church, but  remember  we  are  all  Vermonters  working  to  promote  the  welfare  and  increase  the  happiness  and prosperity  of  the  people  of  our  State.  If  we  will  do  this,  then  I  know  that  under  the  guidance  of  the  great master of us all we shall succeed.”  Those were  the words of one of  the greatest Vermonters  in  our  history,  and  to  him,  on  behalf  of  every citizen  who  resides  within  our  borders,  to  that  man,  Senator  George  David  Aiken,  I  say:  “Welcome  home from the thankful hearts of the people to whom you have given a lifetime of unparalleled service.” We  gather  at  these  historic  proceedings  at  a  time  of  serious  decline  in  the  political  and  economic institutions of this country. We have gone from a period of affluence to a period of deep recession in a very short time. And  during  the  very  same  hours  that  we  find  people  unable  to  get  housing  loans  at  banks,  people dropped  from  payrolls,  people  with  shorter  paychecks,  or  no  paychecks  at  all.  At  a  time  when  political leaders  need more  confidence we  find  that  the  people  no  longer  trust  the  politicians  because  the  politicians failed to trust the people. How did they fail? For one thing, they indulged in the mistaken notion that the people of this country are not brave enough to receive or wise enough to understand the truth. How wrong they were! The  people  are  wiser  than  the  politicians  believe.  When  their  highest  national  leaders  were  saying: “There is no recession . . . things will get better soon” . . . the people knew and said to one another . . . “This is not true. Things are not getting better, they are getting worse.” The observant citizen who reads the back pages of the major newspapers knows that Arab countries and Arab  money  are  attempting  to  buy  up  major  segments  of  American  industry  not  excluding  defense establishments and the fuel sources that make the engines of this country run. Yet,  where  is  the  national  leader,  Republican  or  Democrat,  conservative  or  liberal,  who  will  tell  the people what the challenges are that must be met and what we must do to meet them. In  the  back  rooms  and  private  corridors  politicians  will  admit  to  one  another  that  while  we  have trimmed some waste in the management of our energy resources, it is fundamentally business as usual. If  it  is  not  done  at  the  national  level,  if  it  is  done  in  no  state  in  the  nation  except Vermont,  let  us,  you and I, the executive and the Legislature, spell out in no uncertain terms what our state problems are and what we must do to resolve them. Politicians  have  lost  touch with  the  people  not  only  because  they  have  failed  to  tell  them  the  truth  but also because each political party, Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, has made errors of monumental proportions. There is a drastic change in our political condition. Half of the populace does not want to be associated with  any  political  party.  They  know  that  the  liberals  have  gone wrong  in  believing  that  our  troubles  can  be cured  by  more  spending  and  more  government.  And  they  know  that  the  conservatives  have  gone  wrong  in their preoccupation with the military, private interests and less government.  The message from the people is loud  and  clear.  That  message  is  that  the  political  parties  of  this  country  are  losing  the  confidence  of  the majority of our citizens. No one really knows what lies ahead. Will  our  system  be  fractionalized  as was  the  case  in  post-war  France when  there was  no  real working together . . . no effective central leadership? Or will some other more dreary fate befall us? Lest  my  intentions  be  mistaken  for  one  single  moment,  there  is  time  still  time  .  .  .    to  correct  our political condition . . . but time is running out. What can we in this small State do to improve that political climate? The  press  tells  us  that  the  legislature  is  made  up  of  95  Republicans  and  85  Democrats.  I  see  180 Vermonters. We  must  labor  together  .  .  .  for  if  we  cannot  .  .  .  how  can  we  expect  the  people  themselves  in  their individual and collective capacities to cooperate in the solution of the problems before us? If  the  times  demonstrate  anything,  they  demonstrate  that where we  can  go wrong  is  to  fail  to  seek  the counsel of the people, to search out their views and to ask them for guidance. If  we  succeed  in  showing  this  proper  respect  .  .  .  then  we  will  regain  their  trust  and  this  republic  will work the way it was always intended to work. We  know  as  realistic  human  beings  that  much,  indeed  most,  of  our  fuel  must  come  from  outside  our borders and that there is an interdependence between and among the people of the United States. There are problems that we Vermonters cannot solve alone . . . some that require the cooperation of the federal government, this region, other states and people throughout the union. But as one president once said: “Let us do the best we can with what we have where we are.” A few months ago when we made major efforts to protect our environment one cynic asked: “What are we saving the environment for?” I will tell you what we are saving it for . . . we are saving it for times like these when many Vermonters are going back to the land. They know  the  land cannot do  it all but  they are going  to use  it. They are going  to grow  food on  it and harvest fuel from it and make jobs on it and build homes on it. And they are going to do more than that. They  are  going  to  let  49  other  states  in  this  country  and  the  federal  government  know  that we will  do our  best  to  make  use  of  what  we  have  toward  the  end  that  no  citizen  will  go  hungry  or  cold  or  without medical care. The real task before us is not whether we can add more to those who have much but how much we can do for those who must have more.  As I will detail in my budget message, we have confronted reality here at home and charted a new course for the time. It is a course of fiscal caution, of productivity, of making do in hard times. But beyond that, it is a course that continues our commitments to those less able to help themselves . . . the poor, the disabled, the aged, the handicapped, the mentally ill, and the child in need of dental care. The  course  we  have  chosen  is  based  on  hope  and  confidence  .  .  .  a  course  designed  to  stimulate industrial employment  .  .  .  to promote  tourism  .  .  . stimulate agriculture and  to  improve  the economic  life of our people. The main problem  in America  is not  a  crisis of dollars. Serious  though  that may be,  it  is  a  crisis of  the spirit. There was a  time when America had a  sense of community.   A  feeling  that we were one people  facing our  challenges  and  problems  together.  Some  how,  then  we  did  not  think  of  ourselves  as  this  bloc  or  that group. We must recapture that spirit and adapt it to the difficulties of our times.  Mindful of the traditions of the past, we face an uncertain yet exciting future. We ask your help, we ask your support. We ask greater patience and a greater compassion for your fellowman. We will survive these times and we will do more  than  that. We will create  things for  the enjoyment of  the spirit as well as  the body. We will create  within  our  homes  a  sense  of  belonging.  An  affection  for  one  another.  And  beginning  there,  we  will identify more with our neighbors, our fellow townsmen, our fellow Vermonters and our fellow Americans. Because we are all in this together. And working  together, here and across  the  land,  there  is no obstacle  that  faith,  intelligence, and energy cannot overcome. In  closing  I  leave  you  with  these  words  of  Walter  Lippmann  written  shortly  before  America  entered World War II: “We shall turn from the soft vices in which a civilization decays. We shall return to the stern virtues by which  a  civilization  is made. We  shall  do  this  because  at  long  last,  we  know  that  we must,  because  finally we begin to see that the hard way is the only enduring way.” Thank you. BENEDICTION Benediction was pronounced by Reverend Robert S. Kerr of Burlington. DISSOLUTION The Governor, having completed the reading of his message, was escorted to the Executive Chamber by the Committee.
