Inaugural address of  Allen M. Fletcher  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1912 Thursday, October 3, 1912 Inaugural Message Mr. President, Gentlemen of the General Assembly: I  will  at  this  time  briefly  submit  to  you  certain  suggestions  that  may  possibly  be  of  service  to  you  in  your present deliberations, and I will at some convenient future time communicate with you more at length. To  my  mind,  gentlemen,  the  paramount  issue  in  the  State  of  Vermont  at  this  time,  and  the  most  serious matter  that you have  to come before you, and  to consider,  is  intelligent  legislation  regarding  the  investments of Vermont  money  in  the  State  of  Vermont.  And  by  intelligent  legislation,  I  mean  such  legislation  as  will  not interfere  with  our  present  general  system  of  taxation,  but  which  will  give  the  relief  without  disturbing  a condition which exists  in  this state, and which—permit me  to say—differs  radically  from any other state  in our broad  land. Vermont stands alone with her system of  taxation  in  that she has no state debt  in  the sense  that you understand  the  term,  further  she  has  no  general  state  tax  and  you  should  hesitate  materially  before  you  alter  a condition which in many respects is more to the credit of this state than any other state has been able to put into effect. I wish to speak to you for a mo relative to our court procedure and our judiciary in this state. Some six years ago  a  radical  change  was  adopted—it  was  understood  in  so  doing  that  we  would  economize  and  save  money, and  that  we  would  simplify  and,  expedite  litigation.    Now,  I  think  we  have  accomplished  something  in advancing  litigation—in  expediting  litigation—  but  I  do  not  think,  gentlemen,  that we  have  accomplished  that which we should, when you take into consideration the increase in the cost to the State of Vermont for the same, and  I  wish  to  call  your  serious  consideration  to  that  matter.  Then  I  would  suggest  if  I  may,  that  in  your municipal  court procedure  if  in your  jury  trials  a  full  jury of  twelve men were given—and  there was no  appeal from a judgment of fact, you would accomplish results, you would simplify and expedite. I  would  like  to  call  your  attention  to  the  question  of  conservation  of  water  power  in  this  state.  I  believe, gentlemen,  the  time has arrived  in Vermont when a principal of state policy should be  laid down,  in effect  this: no charters hereafter should be granted carrying with them the right of eminent domain, which did not place that corporation  within  the  control  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  with  the  power  to  lay  down  such  rules  and regulations  as  would  give  the  people  of  Vermont  the  first  right  to  the  use  of  that  power,  subject  to  fair  and equitable  conditions.  Gentlemen,  no  manufacture  from  without  this  state  is  going  to  come  into  Vermont  and locate here, if it can get the power transmitted to it cheaper than the cost of fuel to the manufacturer w the state.  If  your  power  in  time  is  all  taken  up  without  any  conservation  to  provide  for  the  development  of  this  state hereafter,  I  should  not  consider  that  that  comes within  control  of  good  state  policy.   And  I  recommend  to  you that the present charters now existing in the state be amended to bring them within a distinct state policy and the interests of Vermont in a fair, right and proper way. The,  University  of  Vermont:  The  state,  having  given  that  institution  its  name,,  having  elected  to  really control it in effect by electing a majority of its trustees, is morally bound, in my mind, to increase its usefulness in  every  legitimate  and  proper way. Gentlemen,  I  feel  at  this  time,  forced  to  say  to  you  that  I  think  its medical department and its agriculture department need material assistance at your hands, and I hope it will receive it.  I should  like  to  say  in conclusion  this,  it  is a  season when you hear  from various  sources  that  the  interests of  the state will be  advanced  by  your  early  adjournment  and working hard  and going home. Now,  there  is  some  truth in  that, but  to my mind,  the state’s interests will be better advanced by your remaining here until such a  time as you have placed Vermont  in  the advanced  rank with  its sister states,  in constructive progressive  legislation of a safe  and  sane  type. You will  also  hear  from  various  sources  that  there  is  not  sufficient money  to  reach  certain ends—that’s  all  very  well,  gentlemen—that’s  good  state  policy  —  but  to  my  mind,  the  only  limitation  you should  know  is  this:  Is  it  for  the  interests  of  the  state,  and  is  the  state  to  get  value  received?    Gentlemen,  we have  a  system  of  indirect  taxation,  and  it  has  worked  very  well  in  the  State  of  Vermont,  but  there  are  worse things that might come to the state than a direct state tax of a reasonable size — and to my mind, that which you should  keep  before  you  at  all  times  is:    Can  we  pass  an  appropriation  here  which  will  really  advance  the interests of the state, and if so, are we getting value received? In conclusion at this time, permit me to say that I think this is my sixth term up here—if the experience that I have gained during  that  time can be of any  service  to you personally, gentlemen,  I wish you would command it. I should be glad to meet you all individually an the Executive Chamber at any time that you may desire. Gentlemen, I thank you for you; courtesy and your attention.
