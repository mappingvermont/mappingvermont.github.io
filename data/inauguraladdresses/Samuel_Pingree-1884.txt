Inaugural address  of  Samuel E. Pingree  as it appears in the  Journal  of the  Joint Assembly  Biennial Session  1884  Thursday, October 2, 1884 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives in Joint Assembly convened: In  obedience  to  the  expression  of  the  will  of  our  fellow  citizens  and  filled  with  a  profound  sense  of  the obligations  and  responsibilities  which  their  partiality  has  imposed,  I  enter  upon  the  duties  assigned  me  by  the public summons under the laws of the land answerable only for a faithful, fearless, impartial, and, so far as I am able to discriminate, a just administration of the high and varied duties of the executive office. I  feel  that  I  ought  to  be,  and  am  sure  that  I  am,  deeply  grateful  for  this  second  unsought  expression  of  the confidence  of  my  countrymen  in  my  trustworthiness,  in  connection  with  yourselves,  in  the  conduct  of  the delicate, and (more than formerly) complicated, though still harmonious affairs of our state government. And  while  my  deep  sense  of  the  responsibilities  of  the  post  assigned  me  is  relieved  of  all  shrinking apprehension through a wise division, with your Honorable bodies, of the responsibilities for the record we shall make  and  leave  here  for  our  fellowmen  to  analyze  and  pronounce  upon,  when  our  labors  shall  have  been concluded, yet, I devoutly feel  that  the diligent and constant exercise of  the best power of any man or bodies of men would prove abortive of any good if their hope rests for a moment on man’s unaided wisdom. It  behooves  us,  then,  in  all  that  we  undertake  here  to  be  constantly  mindful  of  our  dependence  upon  that Being who holds the destinies of states as well as individuals as in the hollow of his hand.  Let  us,  then,  as  the  servants  of  a  people,  “whose  God  is  the  Lord,”  look  to  that  kind  Providence  which smiled upon our fathers that we may be enabled to preserve and magnify the blessings we have inherited. The  period  which  has  called  us  together  for  the  discharge  of  our  constitutional  trusts  is  one  affording occasion  for  customary  congratulations—perhaps  no  more—although  the  general  health,  prosperity  and happiness  of  our  people  since  our  last  session  have  been  real  in  a marked  degree;  the  harvests  of  the  past  two years  have  been  in  the main  plentiful;  and  the  rewards  of  temperance  and  frugality  have  been  altogether more than fair. The  assembling  of  your  bodies  with  the  executive,  constituting  the  legal  representatives  of  the  people  of Vermont, and having as “the  trustees and servants” of our  fellow citizens “the sole  inherent and exclusive  right of  governing  and  regulating  the  internal  police  of  the  State,”  to  consult,  to  modify  and  enact  rules  of  civil conduct  as  the  supreme  power  of  the  State,  is  an  event  ever  memorable  in  the  political  history  of  any commonwealth of Freemen, and never to be witnessed save under the republican form of government. The  past  is  replete  with  evidences  of  the  uprightness  of  intention,  earnestness  of  endeavor,  and  general success  in  results which have characterized and crowned  the deliberations and acts of  the General Assembly of the State. In all our duties here as the representatives of the people let our zealous care and endeavor be to elevate and perpetuate that honesty of purpose, dignity of demeanor, grasp and dispatch of business which have,, in the past, so  signalized  the  Legislative  bodies  and  the  Executives which  have  preceded  us,  and  for  the  consummation  of this  high  aim  and  end  I  shall  ever  and  earnestly  share  with  you  the  one  purpose  which  should  animate Legislature  and  Executive  in  common,  to  discharge  the  co-ordinate  duties  constitutionally  imposed  upon  each alike, in such a manner that the permanent material interests of the State and the happiness of her people may be advanced at our hands. In  accordance  with  the  custom  of  every  Executive  in  our  past  from  the  patriot  and  diplomat,  Thomas Chittenden,  the  first  Governor,  down  to  my  able  and  accomplished  predecessor,  I  now  present  to  you  a  brief recurrence to, and make some suggestions upon, the present and comparative condition of our now (much more than  formerly)  complex  trusts,  and  Penal,  Reformatory,  Financial,  Industrial  and  Educational  institutions,  all which will demand your attention and some of them your careful consideration. The  Biennial  Reports  of  the  several  State  officers  having  an  intimate  and  particular  knowledge  of  their respective departments will exhibit in detail the present status of the several important financial and other trusts and affairs of the State. The  suggestions  and  recommendations  contained  in  these  Reports,  coming  as  they  do,  from  those  whose conversance with  the  subjects whereof  they  speak,  and whose  judgments  are  necessarily well  advised,  deserve the candid consideration of the Legislature to whom they are addressed and will doubtless receive the same. The Report of the treasurer, which will be before you, presents an itemized exhibit of the financial affairs of the government for each of the last two fiscal years, to the varied details of which your attention is invited, since the public will demand at our hands a closer degree of scrutiny and attention to the subject of their finances than they  exact  upon  almost  any  other  of  the  varied  trusts  reposed  in  their  public  servants,  inasmuch  as  it  most directly  and  universally  affects  all  bodies  corporate,  classes  and  individuals within,  and  not  a  few without,  our borders. From this Report we find that at the close of the last fiscal year (Aug. 1, 1884) the State LIABILITIES were as follows viz.:  Due towns, surplus fund ........................................................................................................    “   soldiers, unpaid balance .................................................................................................    “   suspense account, (the outstanding checks) ...................................................................    “   agricultural college fund ................................................................................................    “   temporary loan of 1882 ..................................................................................................   and the $13,397 62 8,803 60 1,940 24 135,500 00 50,310 37 -----------------     $209,951 83 ASSETS were as follows, viz.: Cash on hand and in bank ...................................................................................................... Balance corporation tax (unpaid) payable in August .............................................................   $18,149 46 75,000 00 ---------------- $93,149 46 The following items in this statement of State liabilities which are not regarded as subject to present (though to possible future) call, and for the meeting of which no present provisions are required are: $13,397 62 U.S. Surplus fund ................................................................................................................... 8,803 60 Unpaid balance due soldiers .................................................................................................. 1,940 24 Suspense account, (old outstanding checks)  ......................................................................... Agricultural college fund ....................................................................................................... 135,500 00    ----------------- Amounting to .................................................................................................  $159,641 46  which  sum  being  deducted  from  the  general  amount  of  liabilities  leaves  the  amount  of  the  same  subject  to  be paid presently, $50,310.37, showing an excess of available assets over current liabilities of $42,839.09. Any comparison of this result with those of previous annual or biennial periods would afford no reliable relative data of information as heretofore, since the basis of raising the public revenues and the dates of paying in the same have become wholly changed by the passage of the Corporation Tax Act of 1882.   EXPENSES OF GOVERNMENT. Sources of revenue for meeting the expenses of administering the affairs of the State government have rested for the last biennial period mainly upon a new basis—the same having been paid only in the past from direct taxation based upon the Grand Lists’ valuations as heretofore, but being chiefly derived under the operation of the “Corporation Tax Law,” so called, enacted by the last session of the General Assembly. The framing of statutes so as to compel an equitable and just contribution towards the burdens of government from every citizen and every interest has been the long sought desideratum of Legislatures and of the tax paying body politic of all countries and of all times. For  many  years  prior  to  1880  we  had  been  relying  upon  a  system  of  taxation  for  the  payment  of  State expenses, which, though fair and just in theory, was regarded by political economists, long before its repeal, as, in  its  practical  operations,  a  most  unjust  and  unequitable  method  of  meeting  the  exigencies  of  the  public demands, through its irregular methods of reaching the property of the citizen or the corporation. The  law—surrounded  though  it  was  by  all  the  safeguards  of  the  requirements  of  official  oaths  to  its  due execution  and  compliance  by  the Listers—soon  fell  into  disregard  by  them  generally,  to  such  a  degree  that  the average Lister, as if by common consent, found customary facility in substantially making solemn oath that one-third or one-half of the known worth of specific property was its just and full value in money. The  law  became  of  no  avail  to  compel  “an  equitable  and  just  contribution  for  the  maintainance  of government”  and men  feel  at  a  loss  to  understand  at  this  day, why  the method  remained  so  long  in  vogue  and upon our statutes, while the inequality and injustice of its enforcement were so manifest to all who observed the varied usages and methods resorted to under it. It gave way to the “Act to Equalize Taxation,” so called, of 1880. That  this  law,  which  imposed  upon  the  taxpayer  the  personal  obligation,  under  penalties  and  perils,  of contributing  his  fair  share  to  the  support  of  the  government  which  protected  him  in  accumulating  and  secured him  in  the  possession  of  his  property,  was  a  step  far  in  the  right  direction,  and  the  closest  approximation  to  a just and practical system of taxation, soon became apparent to all honest men. The  uncounted  thousands  of  personalty, which  had  never  before  been  reached, was  brought  out  and  laid  at the service of the State with the hundreds or less that had not been kept back before from the Assessors.  I  believe  there  a  has  been  no  improvement  in  legislation  in  the  quarter  of  a  century  in which  I  have  had  to do,  professionally  or  officially,  with  the  laws  of  the  State,  which  has  more  universally  and  emphatically commended itself to the approbation and confidence of the people than this Act of 1880. This  law  for  the  municipal  purposes  of  Town,  Highway  and  School  District  revenues  remains  unchanged, but at the last session of the General Assembly a new departure was made in revenue legislation by the passage of the “Corporation Tax Law” above referred to. By  this  law  the  method  of  raising  the  revenues  for  the  support  of  the  State  government  was  completely revolutionized. Great  concern was  felt  by many,  and  various questions were  raised  regarding  the validity,  construction  and application of the law, at the time of its enactment and through the earlier stages of its enforcement, but through the  wise  selection  of  the  present  Commissioner  by  my  predecessor,  the  formulation  and  preparation  of  the proper blanks  and methods  for  the  fulfilling of  the  statute was  attained  and  this work was  supplemented by  the general willingness on the part of the officers of the various corporations to comply with the requirements of the same,  so  that  all  the  corporations  and  persons  reached  by  this  law,  with  a  single  exception,  have  made  the returns required by the same, and taxes were assessed during the calendar year 1883 as follows, viz.: On Express companies ...............................................................................................................  $1,378 71 597 60   “  Telegraph companies ...........................................................................................................   “  Telephone companies ........................................................................................................... 504 58 7,913 26   “  Steamboat, Car and Transportation company ......................................................................   “  Railroads ..............................................................................................................................  85,516 96   “  Savings Banks ......................................................................................................................  52,771 76   “  Trust companies ...................................................................................................................  30,507 67   “  Home Insurance companies ................................................................................................. 6,768 85   “  Foreign .................................................................................................................................  13,355 69 ----------------  $199,337 07 Making a total for the year All which have been paid  into  the Treasury except $2,658.56,  the second semi-annual assessment of  the St. Albans  Trust  Co.,  making  amount  received  by  the  Treasurer  as  appears  by  his  report,  $196,678.51.    Of  this amount the sum of $56,506.70 was paid under protest. The  table  attached  to  the Commissioner’s Report  showing what  corporations,  companies  and persons made payments  under  protest,  and  their  reasons  for  the  same  as  shown  by  the  report,  you  will  find  deserving  of careful notice for the better dealing with the suggestions and recommendations which the report contains. The protest of  the Trust Companies extend  to one-half  their assessment only and are based upon a question involving  a  point  of  constitutionality  in  a  section  of  the  law  itself,  they  alleging  that  the  law  unjustly discriminates  between  them  and  the  Savings  Banks  in  compelling  them  to  pay  one  per  cent  upon  the  average amount  of  their  deposits,  including  trust  funds  and  securities,  while  but  one-half  of  one  per  cent  upon  the average amount of deposits and accumulations is imposed upon the Savings Banks. There are now pending four suits of  law against corporations assessed under  this statute,  the basis on which each  is  predicated  and  the  statement  of  the  defense  claimed  by  the  defendants  in  each  is  fully  and  clearly  set forth  in  the  report  of  the  Commissioner,  and  as  the  defense  in  each  case  rests  upon  grounds  distinct  from  the others,  they will severally call for your analysis and action  if you regard further legislation requisite to the ends of justice. The  suggestions  and  recommendations  of  the  Commissioner  relating  to  section  5  of  the  act  embody  the conclusions  of  the  only  one  who  must  have  been  fully  impressed  with  their  importance  and  necessity,  and  I recommend that his suggestions be met by suitable amendments for the better practical workings of the law. Sections 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 and 19, have all undergone the careful test of their practical applicability to meet the  designs  and  aims  of  the  law,  and  I  commend  their  consideration  to you  in detail  in view of  the  suggestions contained in the Commissioner’s Report. I  am  aware  that  my  predecessor,  Governor  Barstow,  has  given  much  careful  study  and  reflection  to  this subject, both  in  its general aspect and  in  its details during his executive  term, and we may well anticipate as we enter  upon  its  consideration  here  that  we  will  find  in  his  retiring  message  much  that  will  aid  us  in  connection with the Commissioner’s Report in a rightful comprehension of our duties at this session in respect to it. TRUST FUNDS. After  his  usual  clear  and  accurate manner  the  Treasurer  sets  forth  the  several  funds  held  in  trust  by  him  at date of August 1st last, viz.: The Agricultural College Fund (invested wholly in Vermont registered bonds of 1880).................................................................................................  $135,500 00  Bennington Battle Monument fund ....................................................................................... 20,000 00 This fund being invested in three per cent registered bonds. National  Life  Insurance  Company  fund,  deposited  under Act of Nov. 12, 1847, all in U.S. four per cent. bonds .................................................... Burlington  Life  Insurance  Company  fund  under  Act  of Nov. 12, 1874 ................................................................................................................... This  last  fund  is  invested  in  notes  and  mortgages, Burlington  city  bonds,    Burlington  Gas  Light  Co.  stock, 102,165 99 105,000 00 Merchants’  National  Bank,  Burlington  stock.  Howard  and National Bank, Burlington stock. All these investments of trust funds, for which the State is holden, however carefully and judiciously made, should always be regarded with closest scrutiny and concern by the Legislators. It  is  a  duty  which  a  vigilant  and  economic  people  will  always  exact  and  have  the  right  to  demand  at  their hands. In  addition  to  the  above  the  State  Treasury  holds  the  U.S.  Deposit  Money—sometimes  called  “School Fund”—to the credit of various towns and gores to the amount of $13,397.62. Also  there  stands  another  important  trust  in  the  hands  of  the  State  not  heretofore  among  these  high, important  and  perpetual  responsibilities.    I  refer  to  the  “Huntington Fund,” which  the Treasurer,  in  authorizing him to collect and receive of the executor of the last will of Arunah Huntington, late of Brantford, P.Q., “all the property to which the State is entitled under said will, and deposit the same in the State Treasury,” has, with the counsel  and  assistance  of  the  State  Auditor,  successfully  accomplished  and  deposited  the  net  amount  so received, to wit, $205,111.22, in the Treasury in the month of April, A.D. 1883. This fund was collected in the kind of various stocks, bonds, notes, scrip, drafts, cash, etc., as set forth in the details of  the Treasurer’s Report, some of which have already been converted  into other  investments, as  therein specifically shown, so that the amount of this Trust Fund at date August 1st, 1884, is, par value, $219,864.37.  This has been “received” and deposited as above stated, and the Treasurer’s duty in the premises is ended. It  now  becomes  your  duty,  gentlemen,  to  take  such  measures  in  legislation  as  shall  secure  to  the “Government and Legislature of the State of Vermont” this fund and its proper investment and direction for and to the end and purpose sought to be attained by the testator, to wit: For  the use and benefit of  the common  schools.   How  this may be best brought  about will be  the  subject of your candid discussion, deliberation and legislation. That  the  recommendations  and  suggestions  of  the  testator  be  treated  with  your  considerate  and  careful regard so far as the same may be clearly practicable and in no measurable degree an impediment or hindrance to the  attainment  of  the  high  purpose  and  end  sought  to  be  accomplished  under  the  will,  I  would  earnestly recommend.  But  above  all  these  considerations  such  legislation  should be had  as will best  carry out and on  this  trust  for the sole use and benefit of the common schools. How may this be best accomplished at your hands? I  have  not  yet  seen  the  report  of  the  Superintendent  of  Education,  but  have  had  occasion  to  confer  and discuss  this  question  in  a  limited  degree  with  him  and more  at  length  with  others  who  have  given  this  subject thought  and  reflection,  and  I  would  now  recommend  as  one  of  the  means  suggested  by  the  Honorable Superintendent  of  Education,  and  which  commends  itself  to  my  judgment  above  others  that  have  been presented,  that  the minimum period  required by  law  for  the  length of our common schools be  increased  to such a  number  of weeks  above  the  twenty  per  annum  now  required  by  law  as  shall  be  sufficient  for  the  utilizing  of the  income  of  this  fund  in  this  way  for  the  use  and  benefit  of  the  common  schools,  and  that  the  necessary legislation  be  had whereby  the  standard  of  the  school  requirements  as  at  present  existing  shall  be  fully  kept  up in  the  manner  heretofore,  or,  at  least,  independently  of,  this  Trust  Fund,  so  that  the  current  provisions  and requirements  in  the  interests  of  the  common  school  education  of  the  youth  under  the  law,  shall  be  in  no  way diminished,  but  their  securities  supplemented  and  enlarged  by  the  blessings which  this  new  fund was  intended by its donor—a native Vermont philanthropist—to bestow upon them. I regret not to have been able to see the State Superintendent’s Report, which has for long weeks been in the hands of the printer and inaccessible. The same has been true of most of the official Reports until within the past week. Legislation correctionary of this inconvenience has heretofore been recommended. To  continue  this  subject  of  State  finances  I  take  and  collate  from  the  Auditor’s  Report  the  following tabulated statement of results: Auditor’s orders 1884 ......................................................................................................$231,184 45 Court orders 1884 ............................................................................................................  40,782 62 Fines and costs collected, 1884 ........................................................................................  28,694 17 Net court expenses 1884 ..................................................................................................  49,653 89 For the biennial term ending July 31st, 1878, and so forth, the following orders were drawn, viz:   1878 1880 1882 1884 STATE PRISON.

That much yet remains to be done in this reformatory process is altogether probable. Legislation  in  the  right  direction  to  this  end  can  have  much  to  do  in  the  establishment  of  a  well  rectified public  sentiment  against  unwarrantable  extravagances  and  unlawful  exaction  of  public  servants  in  connection with the performance of official duties. It will be further observed from the above table of comparisons that the results show not only a reduction in court  expenses,  but  also  that  the  amount  of  fees  and  costs  collected  have  generally  and  steadily  increased  in amount. The Report of  the Auditor, which will be  in your hands,  though extending  to  the minute details  from which the foregoing results are summarized, is so full of interest that it deserves to be reproduced here in full—that by repetition  and  in  an  increased  variety  of  ways  this  whole  subject  of  State  expenses  may  be  spread  before  the public for their careful scrutiny of the details which go to make up its aggregate. REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF FINANCE. This annual report shows the condition of the Savings Banks and Trust Companies of the State on June 30th last. In view of certain data and recommendations appearing therein I deem it my duty to make special reference to it for the general information of many who may not have it at hand and into whose hands this communication may come. It appears by this report that there are twenty-four savings banks, savings institutions and trust companies in active  business  in  the  State,  with  45,837  depositors  holding  deposits  aggregating  $13,724,291.53,  of  which amount  $11,327,100.78  belong  to  resident  depositors  and  $2,394,218.75  to  non-residents;  the  average  amount deposited by each being $299.35, or about one-third less than the year previous. It  will  be  noticed  by  reference  to  the  intelligent  and  concise  tabulation  arrangement  of  the  Inspector  of Finance  that  there  are  but  272  depositors  having  to  their  credit  over  $2,000  each,  and  that  about  one-half  of these deposits were in the seven trust companies which are not restricted by law in the amounts receivable from any  one  person,  while  the  savings  institutions  are  prohibited  from  receiving  in  excess  of  that  amount  except from  widows,  orphans,  executors,  etc.,  these  persons  being  the  only  beneficiaries  for  which  the  savings  bank was primarily intended. The  recent  law  subjecting  the  excess  of  $1,500.00  of  this  individual  deposit  to  taxation  has  decreased  the number of heavy depositors, “a result,” as  is well said by  the Inspector, “the most gratifying  to  the managers of the most conservative banks.” Of all our savings banks but one has passed its dividend, and that one for the special reason of accumulating with  a  view  of  winding  up.    These  dividends  have  varied  from  four  to  five  per  cent.    This  is  a  result  most gratifying concerning the successful operation and management of our savings banks. This  institution—the  savings  bank—is  constituted  essentially  in  the  interests  of  that  portion  of  our  people who  are  less  able  than  the more  experience  financiers  of  the  community  to  husband  and  convert,  from  time  to time,  their  earnings  and  savings  from  one  kind  of  security  to  another.    It  is,  in  short,  the  bank  of  the  poor,  the widow,  the  orphan  and  the  daft,  who  are  unable  to  find  a  more  remunerative  place  of  investment  for  their savings. It  therefore  becomes  your  duty  to  see  to  it  that  no  safeguard which  your  judgment  and  forecast  can  invent, be  omitted  in  your  legislation,  to  shield  this  institution  from  the  possibility  of  miscarriage,  that  its  beneficent object may be attained according to the original designs and purposes for which it was instituted. The  Inspector  of  Finance  should  be  armed  with  the  sword  of  the  law  that  he  may  protect  this  class  of depositors with the shield of the law. The Inspector has also submitted in his report a series of recommendations which are stated with a degree of conciseness  that  would  seem  to  render  an  abstract  thereof  hardly  adequate  to  a  rightful  comprehension  of  the same;  and  that  these may  be  impressed  upon  the General Assembly  in  their  original  clearness  and  importance, and believing that the same are entitled, in consideration of their vital interest to those of our people having hard earned moneys  to deposit where  they may be  safe  and yielding  the  fruitage  of  a moderate  increase,  and  also  in view of various losses that have come upon some of that class of depositors since the last session of this General Assembly,  through  the  insufficiency  of  the  laws  on  the  subject,  I  here  quote  with  my  full  approbation  and approval the following form his Report, viz.: “I  recommend  the  enactment  of  a  distinct  code  for  the  trust  companies  which  shall  clearly  define  their powers under their charters, that  there may be no uncertainty as to the investment that they may  lawfully make.  As there is no limitation of the amount of loans, which may be made, it follows that the entire assets of any trust company may be  loaned  to one person or upon any collaterals which may be  thought  to be good by  the  trustees or directors for the time being.  In a few instances I have found loans to one person or firm, by trust companies, of  over  sixty  thousand  dollars.  My  predecessor,  in  several  reports,  called  attention  to  the  danger  from excessively  large  loans,  suggesting  that  it would be safer  to make  loans of moderate amounts,  scattered around in various localities, than loans of twenty or thirty thousand dollars in one place, subject to only one misfortune, to hazard the whole amount.” “To  this  sentiment  I  heartily  subscribe.    If  the  laws  should  specifically  restrict  loans  to  any  one  person, corporation or company, or  its  individual members,  to some  limited percentage of  its capital stocks or deposits; and  should  forbid  any  officer  or  trustee  of  trust  companies  and  savings  banks,  borrowing  funds  of  the corporation or becoming surety to it, the result would be beneficial.” I  also  specially  commend  the  recommendations  of  the  Inspector  in  regard  to  the  officers  and  bank examinations, and the investments of school and municipal bonds, to your consideration, and I recommend such legislation  on  your  part  as  will  tend  to  make  available  these  desirable  safeguards  in  the  first,  and  safe investments in the other cases. EDUCATION. The paramount  importance of  this  interest can not be overrated.   Upwards of  seventy-three  thousand of our youth,  being  more  than  one  fifth  of  our  whole  population,  are,  year  by  year,  undergoing  the  training  and education which our common school affords.   Upon  the character and quality of  this school, as an  institution of learning and virtue, the future character and quality of our State institutions largely depend. And  in  it  we  are  not  moulding  and  shaping  the  future  of  our  State  alone,  but  of  others—even  to  the influencing  of  all  where  the  Anglo  American  race  are  planting  or  peopling  new  states  or  enlarging  the missionary operations and successes of mankind the world over. It  is  axiomatic  in  American  politics  that  free  institutions  cannot  subsist  among  an  unlearned  people,  but must draw their life sustenance from the intelligence and culture of the masses—which virtues cover and protect them with an impenetrable aegis. It  is  for  wise  legislation  to  determine  and  direct  how  the  $600,000.00  which  is  annually  devoted  to  the common  school  education  of  these  youth,  by  direct  taxation, may  be made  to  yield  its  best  and most  enduring returns  for  the  welfare  of  the  State  and  for  the  good  of  mankind.    Nor  is  it  the  large  sum  of  money  thus expended that robes this interest in its chief importance.  It is rather the rich returns that we may be assured of to brighten the visions of coming years if the annuity is wisely disposed and applied, or, on the other hand the disappointment and despair that is the sure fruitage of our suffering  this  interest  to  languish  and  die  simply  because  it  is  not  made  to  progress  and  keep  abreast  with  the current of the best regulated states in this regard. Can  it  be  answered  why  Vermont—one  of  the most  nearly  non-manufacturing  states—with  a  foreign  born population of only 40,000, and with her district  school  system a century old, and not cramped or diverted  from its  highest  usefulness  by  any  radical  legislation  or  experiment  for  a  change,  and  with  an  enforced  liberality  in expenditure of money in the interests of education almost proverbial—can it be explained why she should stand so  far  behind  those  states  which  have  never  adopted  that  system  or  have  long  ago  abandoned  it  for  the  town system? A  careful  examination  and  comparison  of  the  various  tables  of  illiteracy  among  the  states  of New  England and  the  West,  coupled  with  a  consideration  of  such  surroundings  and  data  as  are  proper  to  a  rightful comprehension  of  the  subject  and  its  causes,  must  surely  lead  the  honest  Vermonter  to  inquire,  wherefore  are we  being  left  behind  in  the  results  of  these  dissimilar  applications  of  our  zeal  and  wealth  for  the  increase  and diffusion of education among our children? The  limits  of  this  communication  would  prevent,  and  its  proper  scope  and  purpose,  perhaps,  forbid,  the trenching  upon  the  field  of  argument  upon  the merits  of  the  possible  remedy  for  this  (what  has  seemed  to me) evident misapplication and waste of some of our wealth and much of our otherwise most fruitful energies under the inequitable and varied “District System;” but I should at least present to you as my earnest conviction, and I do  confidently  recommend,  that  some  measure  be  adopted  at  your  instance  looking  to  the  universal establishment of the town system of schools in the near future—as probably the most promising of practical and permanent good  to  the  cause of  common  school  education  and of  the  reformation of many of  the  existing  evils which now handicap and thwart its largest beneficence. The system  is of no new devising  in  its advocacy  in our State, but began  to be adopted as organic  law, and, as of course,  in  some of  the new  state near a half century ago—and has become  the prevailing usage of most  if not all of our standard educational states throughout the west and north central portions of our country. I believe that wherever the system has come into state or town, it has invariably come to stay. The  disastrous  effects  and  concomitants  of  the  District  System,  so  tersely  summarized  by  our  National Commissioner of Education—“The small schools, the short terms, the meager salaries, the “cheap” teachers, the incessant change,  the multiplicity of  incompetent and  irresponsible officers, and  instruction devoid of spirit and lacking  the  conditions necessary  to  steady progression”—seem  to  indicate,  (and  the  successes of  the Township System wherever adopted concur therein,) that the time has come when the Legislature of Vermont should meet the demand for a change. THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT AND STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. This college, originally styled “The University of Vermont,” and intended as an institution of learning under the patronage and fostering care of the State, has had a life and history of struggle with misfortune and calamity which  has  fallen  to  the  lot  of  but  few  of  the  seats  of  learning  and  culture  in  our  land.    The  record  of  her  early and  unsuccessful  enterprise  and  efforts  to  start  in  life  on  sure  foundations—the  financial  turns  which embarrassed  and  crippled  her  zealous  and  beneficent  almoners  so  as  to  cause  her  prosperity  to  miscarry  for  a time—the  laying  on  of  the  heavy  hand  of  military  necessity—appropriating  her  halls  of  learning  for  hospital uses  in  the war of 1812—the  loss of  the same by fire  in 1824—and  the  long and varied record of her resolution and  persistency  to  live  and  thrive,  and  attain  a  rank  high  up  on  the  roll  of  the  best  colleges  of  the  land—all unfold  to us  a history  that no Vermonter  can  read  and ponder without  commingled  sentiments of  sympathy  for her  in adversity, admiration  for her courage and persistency, and of personal and  state pride  in her  so complete success at present. And  although  by  our  original  constitution  it  was  declared  that  “One  University  in  this  State  ought  to  be established by direction of the General Assembly,” and this was primarily intended for that one, yet, barring the original grant of  lands, much of which proved of  little value,  the State has done nothing  in  the way of material aid for this college. The  University,  which  was  called  into  existence  by  the  fathers,  and  which  was  expected  to  be  the  future recipient  of  State  encouragement  and  aid,  has,  from  its  earliest  days,  been  dependent  upon  the  charities, beneficence and more recently the largesses of its friends. Would  not  this  seem  an  opportune  moment  for  the  ancient  obligation  of  the  State  to  be  honored,  and,  in imitation  of  our  mother  State,  New  Hampshire,  towards  her  college,  an  appropriation  for  a  limited  number  of scholarships to be granted to our University. I regret that I have been unable at this writing to examine the last report of the Honorable Board of Trustees of the University and Agricultural College.    AGRICULTURE. If there is any single interest that should engage the fostering care and attention of the Legislature more than any other, it is that on which all the others especially depend for the sinews for success and existence. Pre-eminent  in  our State  the  tilling  of  the  soil  and  all  that  class  of  industry which  appertains  to  agriculture, claims, and is by common consent entitled to this distinction. This interest is, most of any, identified with the prosperity of the State.  It has been, and is ever likely to be, the occupation and employment of a large majority of our people. The  manufactures  and  mining  interests—the  handmaidens  of  agriculture—are  also  industrial  concerns  of our  people  of  too  far  reaching  importance  to  be  overlooked  in  the  promoting  and  fostering  justice  of  your legislation. I am requested by citizens prominent in some of these interests to call the attention of this body to the fitness of  having  an  authorized  state  representative  sent  to  the  World’s  Exposition,  to  be  opened  at  New  Orleans  in December  next,  and  I  am  advised  that  a  small  appropriation  will  be  asked  for  as  in  other  states  to  defray  the requisite expense of the same. STATE PRISON. The Report  of  the Directors  of  this  institution  shows  that  the  $5,000,  appropriated  at  the  last  session  of  the general assembly, has been expended for the purposes for which the appropriation was made, and that the same was sufficient for the purpose with the economical utilization of convict labor and material on hand. The  report  of  the  Directors  and  Superintendent  shows  the  Prison  to  be  in  good  condition,  both  in  its management, compartments and financial affairs. Large  appropriations  have  been  called  for,  for  several  sessions  past,  for  the  rebuilding,  repairs  and improvements  in  and  about  this  institution,  and  they  have  been  liberally  made,  and,  in  the  main,  judiciously expended,  so  that  at  this  time  the  Prison  will  compare  in  no  unfavorable  light  with  the  best  arranged  penal institutions of New England. Public  institutions of any character, when  raised and  improved  to  the  level of  the best,  should be kept  there in  the  interests of state credit and economy.   This will require new appropriations  from  time  to  time. The needs of  these  come  to  us  the  most  reliably  through  the  Report  of  the  Directors  and  Superintendents,  through legislative committees and personal examination and observation. Two improvements from the ancient to the modern and most approved methods of repairs are recommended by  the  board.    They  seem  almost  necessary  to  economy,  safety,  cleanliness  and  health,  and  the  expense would not be large.  I fully concur with the board in these recommendations. The rapid decrease in the number of convicts confined here would seem to have reached its minimum in the last biennial period − since  the  falling  from  the number confined on July 31, 1882,  is but one; while  from 1878 to  1880  the  decrease  was  thirty-four,  and  from  1880  to  1882  it  was  fifty-two.    The  whole  number  now  in  our prison is eighty-nine, while at times in the last year there have been but eighty-one.  The average number for the last two years is eighty-eight. About  the  same corps of officers  is  required  for  the management of  the prison  that would be with  twice  the number on convicts.   The expense of  this corps  to  the State would be about  the same as now, while  the  income from convict labor would be doubled; so that the prison, if filled to its utmost capacity, might, as the times now are, become not only self-sustaining, but be a source of revenue to the State—a consummation not to be desired under such conditions. HOUSE OF CORRECTION. This  institution  has  now  been  in  operation  near  six  years  and  is  universally  admitted  to  be  a  success  of  its kind,  not  surpassed  in  quality  for  beneficent  results  in  the  suppression  of  crime  by  similar  institutions  in  other states. I  regret  not  to  have  been  able  to  see  the  Report  of  the  Trustees  in  season  for  presenting  to  you  a  more specific knowledge of this House. THE REFORM SCHOOL. This  beneficent  institution  for  the  detention  and  reformation  of  those  in  our  youth  who  are  criminally disposed,  that  their  downward  tendencies may  be  stayed  and  rectified  under  correct  training  and  they  lifted  up through  a  better  education  and  holier  influences  to  future  respectable  citizenship—has  been  and must  continue to  be  the  object  of  most  watchful  interest,  and  of  ungrudging  bestowment  of  State  aid  and  encouragement through the legislative channels. The  Reports  of  the  Trustees  and  Superintendent  represent  its  present  condition,  buildings,  appurtenances and  lands  entirely  ample  for  all  its wants, with  harmony of management  and workings  of  the  departments,  and that the objects and purposes of the institution are going forward in an unusually gratifying manner.  I  invite your attention  to  the  suggestions of  the Board of Trustees  touching certain needed  legislation  in  the interests  of  the  school,  and  particularly  that which  relates  to  the matter  of  town  contributions  to  the  support  of its inmates. THE ASYLUM. From  the biennial Report of  the Supervisors of  the  Insane you will see  that  the number of  these unfortunate wards of the State confined in this institution remain substantially unchanged—the number of inmates August 1, 441 1882, being  ........................................................................................................................................ and August 1, 1884 ............................................................................................................................ 437 a decrease of only four.   During  that  period  189  patients  were  admitted  to  the  institution  and  190  were  discharged.    Of  these inmates  172  are  supported  (aside  form  the  State  contribution  of  $1.00  per  week)  by  towns;  132  are  supported wholly by the State, and 133 are private patients and are sustained by themselves or friends. In  contemplating  this  stricken  class  of  our  people—bereft  of  home—in  many  instances  of  friends,  and always  of  reason,  it  is  indeed  painful  to  learn  from  the Report  of  the Board  that  not  over  one  in  ten  of  the  437 now in confinement there hold out any reasonable probability of recovery.   This  Supervisor’s  Report,  prepared  with  evident  painstaking  and  elaboration,  I  commend  to  your  careful perusal and study, and  I would especially  invite your attention  to  that part of  the  same wherein  the  inefficiency of  the  present  law  is  adverted  to,  and  to  the  suggestion  of  needed  authority  on  the  part  of  the  Board  to investigate and correct certain existing evils for the remedying of which no adequate authority now exists. THE MILITIA. The organized military force of the State remains unchanged, consisting of one regiment and one unattached company of Infantry and one Light Battery. This force, however well perfected, could not be less, and yet be of that practical utility which the peace and sense of security of a well ordered commonwealth constantly demands. No  state  can  be  regarded  as  reasonably  safe  that  is  not  always  prepared  for  abnormal  emergencies  and dangers calling into requisition at least the appearance of force. An  efficient military  organization,  of  strength  adequate  to  such  ready  expansion  as will  include  “the  young men  fit  for war”  in  times of possible public peril,  is worth,  for  the  fending off of calamity, and  for  the  sense of security it affords a people, all it will cost them, through never required for any actual service. Its  known  existence  carries  peace,  order,  and  obedience  to  the  law  everywhere,  or,  failing  in  this,  it  forms the rallying point for their better enforcement. I  believe  the  force  we  have,  at  the  least,  should  be  zealously  kept  up  to  its  present  high  standard  of efficiency by all the needed means of legislative aid and encouragement. LIBRARY AND CABINET. The  great  need  of  additional  facilities  for  Library  and  Cabinet  uses  has  been  kept  before  the  General Assembly  for  several  sessions  last  past,  through  Executive  Messages,  Reports  of  Committees  general  and special, and through bills introduced and discussed or entombed in committee. This need has become a positive necessity. I cannot better emphasize  this subject  than by  inviting your attention  to  the earnest recommendations for an independent library building in the messages and reports above referred to. FISHERIES. Your  attention will  be  called  to  certain  details  of  the  existing  law  for  the  protection  of  fish, with  a  view  to render the same more effective for compassing the ends sought. In the laudable efforts made within the last year for the enforcement of this statute, it is said that in some of its details inefficiencies have been discovered which tend to hamper it salutary effect. The  importance  of  this  subject  is  of  great  practical  consequence  to  those  who  live  on  the  shores  of  Lake Champlain and to the thousands of our fellow citizens who resort thither for their summer homes. The law should be made effective. UNITED STATES SENATOR. I invite your attention to the duty which devolves upon you to elect a United States Senator from this state to succeed  the  Honorable  Justin  S. Morrill,  the  present  incumbent,  whose  term  of  office  will  expire  on  the  4th  of March, A.D. 1885. By  the  laws  of  the  United  States  relating  to  the  election  of  senators,  this  election  should  be  had  on  the second Tuesday of the session. CONCLUSION. In conclusion, gentlemen, I will only add that the varied interests of our state government, increasing in their complex  relations  every  few  years  by  the  supplementing  of  some  new  public  trust  or  benefaction,  can  be carefully reviewed and blessed by your salutary legislation but once in two years.   In order to wisely deal with this variety of important public concerns which you are sent here to improve as your judgment shall commend, it should be a first care to avoid all legislation which comes of undue haste or incomplete deliberation. So  far  as  may  be  consistent  with  this,  let  our  work  go  forward  with  such  dispatch  as  may  become  the  faithful representatives and servants of a people who demand good work at our hands. }SAMUEL E. PINGREE.   EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, Montpelier, Vt., Oct. 2, 1884.
