Inaugural address of  Josiah Grout  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1896  Thursday, October 8, 1896 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: Elected and sworn  to be Governor of  the State, I humbly enter upon the duties of  the office,  impressed with the importance of the trust. In  so  doing  I  would  gratefully  and  appreciatingly  acknowledge  the  honor  conferred,  craving  the  kind forbearance of all. Good government depends upon wise laws faithfully executed. We  are  assembled  in  regular  biennial  session  to  assist  each  other  in  encouraging  such  government  in Vermont, and under Divine guidance let us enter upon the work of such an under taking. UNITED STATES SENATOR  Among  your duties will  be  the  election of  a United States Senator  for  the  term of  six years  from  the  fourth day of March next, to succeed the Hon. Justin S. Morrill.  FINANCES This  is  probably  the  most  interesting  subject,  all  in  all,  you  will  consider,  and  from  time  immemorial  has been instinctively accorded first position among the message topics of my honored predecessors. Receipts,  disbursements,  resources,  and  liabilities  are  words  suggesting  the  ins,  outs,  reliability,  and emergency of the exchequer. They are the ways and means language of public financiering; four words in the Treasurer’s report, to which your most careful attention is directed, standing for revenue, appropriations, dependence, and credit. The  money  supply  now  occupying  so  much  thought  invites  an  equally  earnest  consideration  of  its  use, wherein lies its value. In raising and appropriating the public moneys be just and prudent; avoid both extravagance and parsimony; keep the resources secure and the credit firm. TAXATION. Our  revenue  flows  into  the  treasury  from  various  sources  and  out  in  various ways.  Instead  of  presenting  to you  a  statement  from  the  Treasurer’s  report,  showing  its  different  features,  it  seems  better  that  you  each examine it for yourselves. It is brief and able, rendering clearer the particular workings of the treasury, then any abridgment of it I can furnish you. From  the  resources  and  liabilities  given,  you will  be  able  to  determine  the State  tax,  additional  to  the  other taxes, necessary to defray the expenses of the State the ensuing biennial term. This  tax should not be  larger  than was assessed  in 1894, assuming  list  to be nearly or quite  the same, and  if upon  re-adjustment,  corporation  taxes  should be  increased  and  special  appropriations  are  kept  at  the minimum, so  that  ordinary  expenses  can  be  the  expectation,  a  smaller  tax  will  suffice.  This  calculation  encounters  the proverbial  IF.    It  depends  upon  the  work  of  the  session,  and  before  we  reach  the  State  tax  question  you  will know by your own conduct how large it should be. CORPORATION TAXES AND TAX COMMISSIONER’S REPORT.  Thirteen  annual  taxes  have  been  collected  under  the  corporation  tax  law;  the  first  in  1883  amounting  to $196,678.51  and  the  last  in  1895  amounting  to  $376,723.04.  The  tax  for  the  last  biennial  period  was $734,582.81,  being  $42,351.62  more  than  for  the  preceding  biennial  period.  These  taxes,  show  a  uniform increase, are cheerfully paid and are  important  to  the State. They should be so assessed and collected as  to deal justly  by  the  corporations  paying  them,  and  at  the  same  time  so  as  to  realize  for  the  State  in  proportion  to  the protection afforded. An inquiry into the equality of assessment is suggested as a proper investigation. The  assessment  and  collection  of  the  corporation  taxes,  constituting  nearly  75  per  cent,  of  the  State’s revenue,  is  a  very  important  official  duty.  The  faithfulness  with  which  the  work  is  done  signifies  much  to  the treasury. Your  attention  is  directed  to  the Commissioner’s  report  for  the  information  it  affords  concerning  this source of income. THE FIVE PER CENT. STATE TAXES. These  taxes  are  equalizers  of  the  school  and  highway  burdens  in  the  different  towns  of  the  State.  They  are drafts upon the stronger in favor of the weaker. Steps in the direction of true democracy calculated to strengthen our education and improve our roads. This  plan  for  upbuilding  the  State,  always  acceptable  to  the  poorer,  is  generally  agreeable  to  the  wealthier towns,  for  they  well  know  any  excess  they  pay,  inures  to  the  benefit  of  the  State  as  a  whole.  All,  believing  in Vermont,  recognize  that  doing  it  to  the  least  is  doing  it  to  the  greatest,  and  so  welcome  the  5  per  cent.  State taxes.  Whether  this  step  in  the  right  direction  should  be  lengthened  is  a  question  for  you  to  decide.  Road improvement  can  profitably  use  more  money  and  incorporated  school  districts  are  reminders  that  the  poorer communities have a right to equality in school burdens. DOUBLE TAXATION. The public burdens  should be borne by all equally, according  to what each  taxpayer  is worth, yet  the grand list  upon which  taxes  are  extended  does  not  rest  upon  such  an  equitable  foundation;  until  it  does  there will  be uneasiness among  the people. The  taxpayer who owes more  than  the appraisal of his personal estate, as  the  law now stands, pays taxes on his debts or on more than he is worth. Offsets against personal property in making the grand list are an acknowledgment that taxes should be paid upon the basis of solvent worth. To  illustrate:  The  debts  of A.  are  the  credits  of B.,  and B.  should  pay  taxes  on  these  credits  unless  he  is  in turn  a  debtor.  If  A.  cannot  offset  his  debts  against  his  property  appraisals  he  pays  taxes  on  more  than  he  is worth. B. may hold  credits  secured on A’s.  farm,  the  full appraisal of which goes  into A.’s  list.  In  this case  the value for which the credit was given and the credit are both taxed. B.  should  pay  taxes  on  the  credit,  for A.  pays  him  interest with which  to  do  it,  but A.  should  not  pay  taxes on the value part of the farm covered by the credit, because he pays interest to B. and owes for it besides. It  is conceded  that  this feature of our  tax system  is wrong, and  that  the parties burdened by  it are entitled  to relief. The  indirect  remedies heretofore proposed are at  the best  theoretical. Some of  them have been  suspected of  making  a  bad  matter  worse.  Remember,  it  is  the  debtor  that  should  be  relieved.  If  farm  mortgage indebtedness wherever  held were  taxed  against  the mortgagee,  the  tax  paid  by  the mortgagor  and  deducted  by him in settling with the mortgagee and the mortgagor allowed offset against his real estate appraisal, the landed values  of  the  State would  pay  taxes  once  and  the  payment would  be  by  the  right  parties.  Each, mortgagor  and mortgagee, would  then pay on what  they  respectively hold  in  the property. This would by  short cut accomplish the desired relief, without changing materially, if in the least, the volume of the grand list of the State. It  is  to be hoped you will give  this subject your earnest attention and unless satisfied  it  is a wrong without a remedy, provide necessary legislation. STATE EXPENSES. Next in importance to income are expenditures.  A contented treasury must receive more than it disburses. The  income  should  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  proper  needs  of  the  State.  In  representing  the  wishes  of  the people,  you  will  be  safe  in  avoiding  new  ways  of  expense  and  providing  for  existing  ways  with  reasonable economy. The  biennial  term  just  closed  records  an  expense  of  $1,140,097.56,  being  the  largest  in  our  history.  The preceding term cost $920,397.48 and the term preceding that cost $1,031,710.92. These are  large biennial expenditures. They  should be decreased  rather  than  increased. The expenses of  the State have gradually argumented during the last twenty-five years; so have our public gratuities and institutions. The  increase  of  expenses  I  apprehend  has  been  principally  occasioned  by  the  creation  and maintainance  of  the multiplied institutions. The  Reform  School,  the  House  of  Correction,  the  Soldiers’  Home,  the  Waterbury  Asylum,  the  Fish Hatchery,  the  State  Board  of  Health,  the  Normal  Schools,  Donations  to  the  Colleges,  the  Experiment  Station, the Railroad Commission, the Grand Isle County Bridges, and the Gettysburg Monument are reminders, in part, of the consideration for which the people have exchanged their money. To denominate  such expenditures, extravagance  is  a misnomer. The State has value  received  and  in most  if not all instances, the investments were wise, patriotic, in the interests of better government and of humanity. The  money  was  in  large  part  for  higher  improvements,  which  mark  our  progress  and  adorn  our  better civilization. Without  prejudice  to  the  past  or  allowing  it  to  influence  the  present,  let  us  discriminately  consider  the various expenses of the State, and according to the times, fearlessly and fairly adjust each item. Previous  to  1880,  our  State  tax  averaged  about  63  cents  for  the  biennial  term,  and  since  it  has  averaged about  14  cents.  The  direct  tax  burdens  to  the  people  have  not  increased,  and  while  we  have  expended  more money it has been for what we needed. STATE AUDITOR’S REPORT. The State Auditor’s concise and able report is an instructive bill of particulars, showing where and for what, the public money is used. It is not convenient in a message, to mention in detail, the various items accruing, for instance, under the head of court expenses, salaries and the numerous other classes of expense and the Auditor’s report  showing  plainly  what  you  ought  to  know  upon  this  subject,  fortunately,  renders  such  a  message unnecessary. I respectfully refer you  to  it, urging upon your attention,  the business  it presents, a study of which will  assist  in  reaching  an  intelligent,  economical  action upon measures  inviting money  from  the  treasury. Your attention  is  especially  directed  to  court  expenses, which  it  is  claimed,  have  increased without  apparent  reason. The  fees  paid  by  the  State  in  State  cases  for  the  biennial  period  just  closed,  amounted  to  $4,643  and  for defending respondents $9,826. A limitation placed upon these fees might do justice and make a saving. Expenditures  of  all  kinds  are  quite  in  your  hands,  yet  you  can  depend  upon  my  hearty  cooperation  in  any efforts you make to keep the money flow from the treasury at “neap tide.” Special appropriations should indeed be very special to receive your sanction. Small appropriations, incidental to State institutions and necessary to their preservation or more economical management, will be expected. We are committed to care for our own, and an economical provision of a businesslike character, for all State institutions, is an evident duty. In  considering  retrenchment  ascertain,  in  the  interest  of  the  public  welfare,  what  we  can  do  without,  and then  do  without  all  such  things.  Apply  the  same  economy  to  public,  as  acting  prudently,  you  would  in  private life to your own affairs, and the State will be conserved to the best of your ability. ROADS AND THE STATE ROAD COMMISSION. Good  roads  are  an  index  of  civilization  and  poor  roads  are  a  heavy  tax  upon  any  community.  A  general interest  in  road  improvement  exists  throughout  the  States.  Early  in  our  history  national  appropriations  were made  for  interstate  turnpikes,  then came  railroad building, absorbing all  thought concerning  traveled ways,  and now we are returning to first principles in which the better road figures conspicuously. Vermont is interested in all her roads alike, and encouraged by the progress made it is hoped she will extend the  system  of  permanent  road  improvement  already  so  successfully  begun.  The  5  per  cent  State  tax  and  any enlargement of  it  should  be  exclusively  expended  in  aid of  this  system. Successful  road  improvement has been accomplished in other States through individual contribution from the locality to be directly benefited. A measure authorizing competitive subscriptions from neighborhoods asking the State tax and awarding the tax  to  tile  locality offering  the  largest  local contribution would  carry out  this  thought, and would materially aid in realizing the object sought. Expensive road building should be avoided and  the minimum, not  the maximum cost of a good road should be the guide in carrying out the reform. Probably no one thing will attract temporary and permanent dwellers to the State more than good roads. If  the  policy  of  permanent  improvement  is  continued  by  means  of  State  funds  there  should  be  a  State supervision  of  their  expenditure  and  perhaps  this  can  not  be  provided  for  any  better  than  to make  a  permanent State  Road  Commission,  giving  it  more  voice  in  determining  the  character  and  location  of  the  reform. Regarding this subject nearer than almost any other to the material prosperity of the State it is consigned to your care. RAILROADS AND RAILROAD COMMISSION. For  full particulars  showing  the condition, business and management of  the  railroads of  the State,  reference should be made  to  the able  report of  the Railroad Commissioners, where a  full account  is given of  the different systems within the jurisdiction of the State. The  Railroad  Commission,  born  of  a  right  to  supervise  the  doings  of  railroads,  is  now  ten  years  old.  Its powers are said to be too limited. It is old enough to speak through its record for itself. If it can be strengthened to  render  the people any better service  than  they now  receive  let  it be  so  strengthened. Let  it be made complete in  all  respects  for  doing  in  a  fair,  just  way  to  all  concerned,  the  most  good.  You  will  give  this  subject  your attention and consider whether the railroads should not pay a portion of the expense of the Commission. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. This Board  is  rendering  faithful  service  along  the different  lines of work  it  conducts,  and doing much good in various ways. Its meetings held  in all parts of  the State supply food for  thought, awaken  interest and quicken endeavor  among  the  farmers.  It  is  a  State  institution  that  goes  about  doing  good.  It  has  rendered  an  important service in furnishing statistical information to sellers and buyers of farms and summer tourists. TUBERCULOSIS. This dread disease among stock has created a deep interest and incurred not a little expense. The mystery of the disease and uncertainty of  its  treatment dwell so much  in  the unknown,  that more  than ordinary  interest has centered in the methods employed to eradicate it. The  tests made upon which slaughters have been based are as convincing as experimental work can be, and undoubtedly point the way to extermination as clearly as present knowledge upon the subject is able to. After examinations have covered the State, and should they not do so as soon as possible, whether invited or not, a more definite account of presence, progress and control of  the disease can be kept.  If  the present work  is in the right direction let it proceed until reduced to a system by which an accurate estimate can be made of what is being accomplished. The compensation  for slaughters  is perhaps as  just as can be devised  in  such cases. The disease  exposed by  slaughters,  in  every  instance,  so  far  as  reported, whatever  it may  be,  is  something  common consent pronounces incompatible with healthy animals and healthy food. This  subject  invites  your  attention  that  the  public  and  the  individual  may  be  better  satisfied  with  and  feel more secure in what is being done. The slaughters during the last biennial period cost the State $20,000.   STATE BOARD OF HEALTH. The work  of  this Board  should  not  be  overlooked  nor  its  needs  neglected.  That  its  report will  be  consulted and the importance of its duties appreciated is the common desire of an interested people. SOLDIER’S HOME.  This  institution,  true  to  its  name,  is  a  home  for  the  indigent  veteran  of  the  late war.  It  is  filled,  the  greater part  of  the  time,  with  those  who  shared  the  dangers,  endured  the  hardships  of  that  gigantic  struggle  and  have grown  old,  feeble  and  poor. The  generosity  of  a  grateful  people  in  1884  determined  at whatever  cost  the  brave preservers  of  the  union,  being  needy,  should  have  an  alternative  between  a  home  and  the  poor  house.  This determination  stands  upon  the  records  of State  legislation,  a monument  of  patriotic  gratitude,  to  the  soldiers  of that war, whether dead or living, rich or poor. I need not suggest that you consider the needs of this institution in the same spirit that has always characterized Vermont’s bearing towards the old soldier. INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. This  institution,  in  reality  a  school,  such  a  blessing  to  so  many  boys  and  girls,  benefits  the  State  in  more ways  than  at  a  glance  appear.  It  restrains  youthful  wanderings,  and  fits  for  men  and  women  the  wanderers.  It discharges  its  inmates higher  in  the  scale of being  than  it  receives  them.  Its purpose  and management  are  to be commended. Your  attention  is  directed  to  the  report of  the  trustees  and  the  recommendations  therein  contained as to the needs of the school. STATE PRISON. This  institution  having  changed  the  contract  for  its  labor  and  provided  new  machinery  incident  to  the change,  expects hereafter  to be  self-sustaining,  a desirable  condition  for  a  penal  institution  to  enjoy,  calling  for congratulations  to  State  and  management.  A  small  farm  utilizing  a  certain  class  of  the  prison  labor  and  a keeper’s dwelling  should be added  to  the property of  this  institution. Such additions would save  the State more than the interest on their cost. HOUSE OF CORRECTION. The much  needed  improvements  having  been  accomplished within  the  appropriation  authorizing  them;  this institution is now a credit to the State. Short  terms  of  imprisonment  prevent  as  profitable  employment  of  its  labor  as might  be made  under  longer terms. The earnings, however, compare favorably with similar institutions in other States. The  return  by  the  directors  of  about  $4,000,  the  unexpended  portion  of  the  appropriation  of  1894,  is  a welcome surprise to the treasury.  PRISON REFORM. The  criminals  of  a  penal  institution  should  be  classified  according  to  previous  life,  offence  committed  and general  character  of  the  individual; which  suggests  putting  prison  life  under  reformatory  discipline,  so  that  the inmate  will  be  a  better  person  at  discharge  than  at  commitment.  The  principal  being  that  the  State  has  the criminal in charge simply to secure the public against his vicious tendencies while he is being punished, and not to  hinder  in  any way  the  development  of  his  better  nature  and  growth  in manhood;  and  in  a  broader  sense  that he  should, while  restrained, be  subjected  to moral  influences  so  that he will be nearer  to,  if not  absolutely  in,  a better life when entitled to his liberty. Vermont has hardly kept pace with the other States in legislation, looking to a return of those who have erred to the paths of good citizenship. If  a  move  should  be  made  in  this  direction  I  am  sure  I  need  not  bespeak  at  your  hands  its  careful consideration. THE ASYLUM. The  Waterbury  Asylum  is  the  most  important  of  our  State  institutions.  In  design  and  completion  it  is  a model.  Humanely  and  economically  administered  it  is  a  credit  to  the  State.  It  has  cost  about  $350,000,  and being exclusively under State control will accomplish an interesting saving in the care of our insane poor. Under  the Poland pauper  law,  the expense of  this unfortunate class became a State burden  instead of a  sub-divided one among the several towns. This  centralization  of  the  burden  tends  to  an  equalization  of  it,  and  is without  objection  unless  it multiplies the number of patients. The  records  at  Waterbury  casually  observed  do  not  show  such  a  tendency.  With  it  in  view  to  protect  the Asylum against such possible imposition, I recommend that you investigate this subject and act according to the information your investigation affords. The inmates can be more humanely cared for at this institution with less expense and greater security to society than by the towns. It  is  somewhat  in  the  nature  of  a  common  cause  to  provide  for  the  insane  poor, which  the State  is  as much interested  in  as  the  town.  Patients whose  condition  still  invites  treatment  and  those  beyond  the  reach  of  such  a benefit  should  remain  in  the  asylum,  the  former  class  that  they may  be  cured  and  the  latter  that  the  close  of  an unfortunate life may be made as comfortable as possible. The insane poor of the State should be cared for at the asylum. SAVINGS BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES. These  institutions  are  reported  in  good  condition.  Deposit  withdrawals  have  increased  of  late  under  the menace  to  financial  security  occasioned  by  political  discussion.  Trusting  the  prayer  of  the  people  will  be answered soon, this disturbance is not expected to last long. THE PROHIBITORY LAW. For  nearly  half  a  century  prohibition  has  been  an  omnipresent  theme  with  the  people  of  Vermont,  and  a study of temperance has become a feature of our educational system. It has stood and stands a bulwark between brutality  and  home,  order  and  riot,  the  better  and  the  worse  in  all  things.  The  prohibitory  law  has  occupied  a conspicuous place upon our statutes and signally aided the cause of temperance. It  has  not  exterminated  from  our  society  all  disposition  to  violate  its  provisions,  nor  does  any  law  destroy the  germ  of  transgression  but  it  has  to  a  very  satisfactory  extent  restrained  the  offender,  making  rum  selling unprofitable and a reproach. Violations are the exception and confined mostly to the larger places. The  general  temperance  of  our  people  is  superior  to  that  of  any  sister  State.  Our  prohibitory  law  insures  a better home for the laboring man and his family here in Vermont than in any other community of its size on the face of the earth. We have  reason  to congratulate ourselves upon many  things but upon no one  thing more  than  the character which has become a part of our life since prohibition has guarded the avenues of our society. With  these  and  other  considerations  in  full  view  we  are  confronted  by  the  usual  biennial  inquiry,  shall  the prohibitory law make way for high license, or shall the law be more carefully enforced? Among the things clear to  judgment  and  conscience  is  the  demand  for  a  more  careful,  diligent,  day  and  night,  everywhere  present enforcement of the law. Such  attention  should  be  given  the  subject  as  to  render  it  very  inconvenient  if  not  impossible  to  indulge  in violation. Law,  however  good,  not  enforced,  becomes  bad,  and  soon  imparts  its  character  to  the  people  enacting  it.  The  wisdom  of  the  fathers,  traceable  in  our  society  and  our  institutions,  urges  earnest  enforcement  of  all  our laws. Public  sentiment  in  many  localities  regards  the  enforcement  of  the  prohibitory  law  differently  from  the enforcement  of  other  law,  and  in  my  opinion  you  should  provide  better  pay  to  the  officers  called  upon  to enforce it. Provide  in  such  way  as  commends  itself  to  your  discretion  a  better  enforcement  of  this  law  or  public expectation will be disappointed. Salary  the  municipal  trier  and  compensate  the  prosecuting  officer  according  to  the  fruits  of  his  labor.  If prosecuting officers were paid special fees, under a well-regulated system, in cases arising under the prohibitory law, the county courts approving semi-annually their accounts, better enforcement might follow. Officers  cannot  nurse  crime  in  Vermont  for  the  fees  derivable  from  prosecuting  it  unless  the  people  are willing. Interest the prosecuting officer and make it an object for him to do his work, if you would be sure of the best service. Pursuing and punishing crime as a work of love cannot always be relied upon. EDUCATION. The  strength  of  our  State  is  in  the  character  of  our  people,  which  is  determined  by  our  education.  The schools  are  the  moulding  sand  in  which  the  common  mind  is  formed.  The  best  school  is  none  too  good.  The district  school,  has  outlived  its  early  usefulness,  of  which  we  have  reason  to  be  proud,  entered  a  transition process,  resulting  in  the present  town system, with which some are yet dissatisfied. The dissatisfaction with  the district system arose  from natural causes, and were a  return made  to  that system  the same dissatisfaction would recur. The reasons for the success of the system are no longer a part of our life, and we must use some new plan for  conducting  our  schools. Originally  opposed  to  town  schools,  yet  remembering  the  disadvantages  of  the  old district  and  intermediate  system,  I  believe  the  existing  law  as  good  as  any  change  would  afford.  It  should  be borne  in mind,  though,  that  the  incorporated districts prevent  in  towns where  they exist a  fair application of  the town system. If concessions could be arranged to obviate these complaints contentment might be expected. COLLEGE. The colleges are successfully pursuing their lines of work. The University at Burlington reports a prosperous condition  and  so  does  the  college  at Middlebury.  Norwich  University  is  progressive.  Its  Increasing  attendance speaks well for its disciplines and the proficiency of its work. The Agricultural College and Experiment Station are conducting a work in which the agricultural classes are becoming more and more interested. NORMAL SCHOOLS. These  schools  in  the  report  of  the  Commission  appointed  by  joint  resolution,  number  346,  General Assembly 1894, are presented to your consideration for such action as in your judgment suits the facts. The people wish every school  in  the State well, and  implicitly  trust  to your wisdom as  their representatives, in  so  disposing  of  this  important  question  as  to  not  impair  the  usefulness  of  our  educational  system  and  to  so bestow or withhold their money in the premises as to accomplish, in the interest of education, the most good for the greatest number. FISH AND GAME. Your  attention  is  directed  to  the  report  of  the  Fish  and  Game  Commissioner  and  Superintendent  of  the Hatchery.    It  appears  that  the State  has  an  interesting  property  in  this  line,  costing  already  quite  a  little money, and  promising  to  cost more. The  fish  and  game  of Vermont  properly  protected  constitute  a  property  of  general value to the people. These interests should be fostered. For a knowledge at the needs in this direction see the recommendations and estimates in the reports referred to. UNIFORMITY OF LAWS. Hon.  Alfred  A.  Hall  of  St.  Albans,  appointed  by  my  predecessor,  Commissioner  upon  the  Uniformity  of Laws, has reported his doings pursuant to such an appointment. His commission having expired, if further work in  this  direction  is  desired,  your  action  in  the  matter  will  be  necessary.  Uniformity  in  the  laws  of  the  several States  as  more  particularly  pointed  out  in  the  Commissioner’s  report  is  undoubtedly  desirable,  and  can  be completed now with as little expense as any other time. FIRE MARSHAL. It  is  requested  that  an  office  be  created  to  discover  the  origin  of  fires  consuming  property  covered  by insurance.  Such  detective  officer  would  supply  a  need  in  which  the  people  and  their  insurance  companies  are mutually  interested. His work would  lessen  the moral hazard of  fire  insurance  risks and accomplish a  saving  to the  companies  and  a  lower  rate  to  the  policy  holders.  Whether  it  would  do  this  or  not,  it  has  the  moral recommend of being a proper move to expose and punish a crime somewhat common. A measure creating such an  office,  the  expense  to  be  borne  equally  or  in  such  proportion  as  you  might  consider  just  by  the  insurance companies and the State, would receive my approval. ATTORNEY GENERAL. It is a very general opinion that the office of an Attorney General would aid the administration of the State’s affairs and accomplish an annual saving to the Treasury. I recommend that you inquire into the cost to the State of  counsel  in  prosecuting  State  cases,  and  doing  other  State  business  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether such an office cannot be wisely authorized.  If such an office can be created within  the cost of what  is now paid by the State for legal services, I recommend the proposition to your favorable consideration. COMMISSIONS. Commissions or boards are frequently created designed to assist the service in special ways which generally cost much more than expected. When authorized they should be carefully limited as to expense to the State, so that thousands of dollars are not entailed unawares upon the public expenditures where hundreds are contemplated. Too much care cannot be exercised in this direction. NATIONAL GUARD. Our  militia  consists  of  twelve  companies  and  a  battery  of  four  pieces.  Its  discipline  and  efficiency  are commendable. Though the guard is not large, yet military organization being expensive, it is all in these times the State can afford.    The  officers  and  men  make  a  very  considerable  sacrifice  in  time  and  money  in  affording  us  what  we have  in  this  respect.  What  they  receive  does  not  make  them  whole,  so  the  people  should  thank  them  for  the patriotism and public spirit they contribute towards the military establishment of the State. The  permanent  camp  ground  near  Fort  Ethan  Allen  when  completed  should  accomplish  a  saving  in  the current expenses of the militia, and prove conducive to the better equipment of the organization. SPECIAL RECOMMENDATIONS. Believing  the  Waterbury  Asylum  sufficient  to  accommodate  all  our  insane  poor,  and  that  the  trustees  and physicians  of  the  institution  can  properly  supervise  its  administration,  I  recommend  a  repeal  of  the  law authorizing  commitments  to  the  Brattleboro  Retreat,  and  that  you  abolish  the  Board  of  Supervisors  for  the Insane. The pay of  the State boards varies  from  three  to eight dollars a day and  I  recommend  that you consider  this subject with  a  view  to  establish  a more  uniform  compensation,  according  to  the  importance  of  each  board  and the service rendered by them respectively. I  recommend  that  the  law  authorizing  the  appointment  of  Railroad  Commissioners  be  amended  and  the official  term  of  the  members  of  the  commission  made  to  expire  so  that  one  only  will  retire  from  office  each biennial period. VERMONT. Vermont  first,  after  the  historic  thirteen,  would  have  been  one  of  a  more  historic  fourteen  if  the  sturdy independence and Puritan patriotism of her early manhood had been properly recognized. Her  sisterhood  in  the  family  of  States  has  been  harmonious  and  progressive.  By  common  consent,  she occupies  a  position  in  the  honored  galaxy  constantly  in  sight.  This  prominence  is  the  pride  of  our  people.  The assembled  wisdom  and  virtue  has  always  faithfully  guarded  our  honor  and  inspired  our  progress.  May  the legislature  of  1896  promote  this  excellence,  so  bravely  given  by  the  fathers  and  jealously  fostered  by intervening  generations.  May  our  associated  faithfulness  and  prayerful  endeavor  hand  unimpaired  to  our successors this expectation of continuing honor. CONCLUSION. Unless  Thanksgiving  fails  to  adjourn  your  deliberations,  in  an  even  forty  days  you  will  conclude  your labors;  deduct  for  an  adjournment  to  vote  the  presidential  ticket  and  thirty-six  or  seven  working  days  are  the possible length of the session. When in the exercise of a constitutional prerogative, to outline the business of the session, I have, consulting brevity and abridgment, felt compelled to present thirty or more different subjects, each one of which may have as many  or more  ramifications,  and  that  you  too may  have many  business matters  to  offer,  I  am  reminded  that the session is short. When,  too,  judging  by  former  sessions,  I  recall  the  occasional  adjournments  suggesting  a  probable  ten  or twelve days during  the session, and  that your  respective bodies will patiently entertain and pass upon  the many corporation  measures,  the  subject  matter  of  which  can  as  well  for  all  concerned  be  incorporated  under  the statutes, I am still more forcibly admonished of the shortness of time in which to do so much. When  also  it  appears  that  it  costs  the  State  fully  twelve  hundred  dollars  for  every  working  day,  three hundred dollars for every hour and five dollars for every minute, I am sensible of the value of our time. Therefore I would earnestly recommend: 1st.  That  all  bills  be  introduced  on  or  before  the  twenty-fifth  day  of  the  session,  and  that  such  day  be determined early by resolution, after which no new business can be offered. 2nd.  That  your  respective  bodies  refuse  to  entertain  any  corporation  measure,  the  subject  matter  of  which can be incorporated under the statutes. 3rd. That you keep adjournments at the minimum and make them all depend upon some common necessity, bearing  in  mind  that  every  day  of  unnecessary  adjournment  is  equivalent  to  a  useless  appropriation  of  twelve hundred dollars from the treasury. 4th.  That  you  begin  now,  not  delay  till  the  closing  days  of  the  session,  to  prepare  the  business  to  be considered, so that a better system will attend and assist your labors. The  constitution wisely  requires  the  executive  branch,  to  prepare  and  present  at  the  opening  of  the  session, its business  suggestions,  and  the  legislative branch will  find  it of great  economic  advantage  to  follow  the  spirit of this requirement so far as practicable in its work. These  recommendations  observed  and  the  business  of  the  session  is  under  better  system, will  receive more careful attention,  resulting  in more mature enactments and  last but not  least  the  rush  incident  to  the  last days of the  session  and  especially  the  jostling  confusion  of  the  last  night  during  the  weary  hours  of  which  the  most important measures are frequently considered will be happily avoided. Impressed with  the  sense  that  the  time of  the  session  cannot be  too  carefully  accounted  for  to  the State  and that  our  good  name  for  accurate  laws  cannot  be  too  sacredly  guarded,  I  urge  as  your  present  help,  the  same patriotic purity of purpose and wise discrimination that has from the foundation of our government so kindly led our people.
