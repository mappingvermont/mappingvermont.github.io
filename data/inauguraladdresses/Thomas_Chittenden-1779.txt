Executive  Speech of  Thomas Chittenden  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume II.   1779     October 14, 1779. A SPEECH OF HIS EXCELLENCY THOMAS CHITTENDEN, ESQ.,  Gentlemen of the Council and Assembly: The honor conferred on me by  the freemen of  this State,  in appointing me  their chief magistrate, demands a return of my warmest  thanks: at  the same  time, I regret my  inabilities  to support  the character of so  important a station.   Notwithstanding,  as my  appointment  appears  so unanimous,  it  affords me  the highest  satisfaction,  and is to me a confirmation of their general approbation of my former conduct; therefore, I shall consider it my duty to  serve  the  ensuing  year,  and  by  Divine  assistance,  shall  labor  to  continue  an  equal,  steady  firmness,  and impartial  administration  of  justice,  which  has  hitherto  governed  my  conduct;  relying  on  the  candor  and assistance of my council and the Legislature for my support. Gentlemen: The  Legislature  having  constitutionally  met,  I  cannot  forbear  expressing  to  you  my  highest  satisfaction  in the many great and important advantages arising from the due execution and careful administration of the laws, since they took place, and cannot but rejoice when I reflect on the infinite difference between a state of anarchy and  that  of  a  well  regulated  government;  the  latter  of  which  we  daily  experience.    And  I  most  earnestly recommend  to  all  magistrates,  and  others  in  authority  under  me,  together  with  the  freemen  over  whom  I  have the  honor  to  preside,  to  persevere  and  let  their  conduct  be  uniformly  just,  and  upright,  and  encourage  one another  to  unite  in  the  supporting  and  maintaining  their  common  rights;  which  cannot  fail  to  recommend  this State  to  the  impartial  world.    At  the  same  time  am  unhappy  to  inform  you  that,  notwithstanding  the  generous and  lenient measures with which  the disaffected  inhabitants  in  the  lower part of Cumberland County have been indulged, 1  yet  they continue  in  their unjustifiable obstinacy against  the authority of  this State;    I shall however, recommend  the  suspension  of  the  laws 2   intended  to  have  been  executed  on  those  offenders,  at  present,  in consequence of a letter received from his Excellency John Jay, Esquire, President of Congress, inclosing certain acts  passed  by  that  honorable  board,  relating  to  a  final  settlement  of  all  difference  subsisting  between  this  and the adjacent States;  which I now submit to you for your consideration; a subject of the greatest importance, and demands your most serious attention. 3Your  agents  to  Congress  have  attended,  agreeable  to  their  instructions,  from  time  to  time.    Their proceedings I shall now lay before you for your perusal and approbation; which, I hope, will prove satisfactory.  From  every  circumstance,  I  think we  have  the  highest  reason  to  believe  that  from  the  efforts  of  our  agents  and the  interposition  of  Congress,  our  unhappy  disputes with  the  neighboring  States, will  soon  terminate  in  a  final and happy issue. With respect to the present situation of the domestic affairs of the State, it is with pleasure that I inform you that the measures pursued by the Board of War, by the assistance of Divine Providence, have proved effectually sufficient  to defend our  frontiers, against  the  ravages of  the common enemy, while  they have been permitted  to execute  their  horrid  vengeance  on  many  of  the  innocent  inhabitants  of  the  different  parts  of  the  continent; which,  in  some  measure,  proves  the  approbation  of  Heaven  to  our  Independence,  and  justifies  the  measures pursued  to  support  and  defend  it.    As  the  time  for  which  the  troops  now  in  service,  are  engaged,  expires  the middle of November next, you will be careful to make such provisions for future defence, as your wisdom shall direct.                                                  1 See the proclamation of pardon, Appendix H, Vol., I 2 The act specially  referred  to was  that of June 1779, “to prevent persons  from exercising authority unless  lawfully authorised by  this State,” which, though general in terms, was of course specially aimed against all persons who should attempt to act in the name and by the  authority  of  New  York.    The  penalty  for  the  first  offense  was  a  fine  not  exceeding  one  hundred  pounds;  for  the  second  not exceeding forty striped on  the naked body; and for  the  third,  the right ear was  to be nailed  to a post and cut off, and  the forehead was to be branded with the letter C [contumacious?] with a hot iron. – See Slade’s State Papers, p. 389. 3  For  resolutions  of  Congress  of  June  1779,  see  Vol.  I,  p.  520;  and  for  resolutions  of  September  1779,  and  the  consequent  action  of Vermont, see Appendix B. Gentlemen of the Assembly: I  shall,  from  time  to  time,  during  the  session,  digest  and  communicate  to  you,  such  other  matters  as  shall appear to me to require your attention, in a full confidence that the same zeal to promote the common cause, for which  the  inhabitants  of  this  State  have  hitherto  been  distinguished,  will  be  equally  conspicuous  in  your deliberations. THOMAS CHITTENDEN.
