Inaugural Address of  Madeleine M. Kunin  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1987   Thursday, January 8, 1987 Inaugural Address  Mr.  President,  Mr.  Speaker,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  distinguished  guests  from  the  executive  and  judicial branches, Members of the House and Senate, Friends: It  is  with  much  anticipation  and  a  deep  feeling  of  honor  that  I  stand  before  you,  ready  to  shoulder  the responsibilities of serving the State of Vermont for the next two years. Thank you for giving me your trust. As  the  oath  of  office  echoes  in my mind,  I  confess  that  I  am  once  again  deeply  impressed  by  the  power  of the office and the democratic process by which we govern ourselves. From  one  perspective,  our  democratic  system  seems  so  untidy,  raucous,  and  unpredictable.  Yet  today,  our democratic tradition has produced an orderly and fair system, truly representative of all Vermonters. On a personal level, I thank my husband, Arthur, our children, relatives and friends. They have sustained me and I am exceedingly grateful to them. Quite  simply  put,  your  love  and  affection  has  given  me  the  courage  and  determination  to  emerge triumphant. I  thank my  staff,  the  cabinet,  the men  and  women  who  work  in  state  government,  and  the members  of  the Legislature for their part in enabling us to look back on this first term with a proud sense of achievement. Our first task, as we embark on this new biennium, is to decide where to continue existing policy and where to make a break with past practice to set a new course. Today,  I  depart  from  the  tradition  of  thematic  inaugural  addresses  and  ask  you  to  rivet  your  attention  on  a single subject: Education. I view this as the most important issue this Legislature has to resolve. Some  one  hundred  years  after  the  State  of  Vermont  first  struggled  to  resolve  the  inequities  of  education financing,  I  believe  we  are  about  to  break  new  ground  and  begin  an  historic  session.  I  am  determined  that  we move boldly forward to a new and fairer method of funding education. I promise you I will use all the power granted to me in this high office to bring about the changes necessary to  achieve  equal  educational  opportunity  through  equal  spending  and  equal  tax  burdens. Our  ability  to  come  to terms with  this  issue will not only determine  the outcome of  this  legislative  session,  it will dictate  the  future of education and the quality of life beyond the year 2000. The problem  is  simple:  today  in Vermont,  the quality of education a child  receives depends on where he or she resides. This is neither fair, nor good for the future of our state. Allow me  to be  specific and compare  two elementary  schools  to  illustrate  the problem. What would we  see if we were given a look inside the Hiawatha School in Essex Junction and the elementary school in Charleston? In Charleston, the science textbooks are worn and out-of-date. Not every child has one. They must be shared with another class. The  library  is  sparse,  reference  works  and  computers  are  non-existent,  as  are  recent maps  and  globes.  The arts,  health  education  and  physical  education  are  not  offered  by  teachers  certified  in  those  fields.  There  is neither a librarian nor full time principal. At  the  Hiawatha  School,  there  is  an  abundance  of  instructional  material.  Each  child  has  not  only  his  own textbook, but computers are readily available. There is a computer club. The library is rich in materials. Art and music instruction are provided weekly in rooms especially designed for that purpose. The list could continue. The differences are dramatic and not hard to explain. In fiscal year 1985, the Charleston school spent $2005 per pupil, less than half of what was spent at Hiawatha, and $1300 below the Vermont average. Why  the  disparity?  Is  it  because  the  parents  in  Charleston  don’t  value  education  as  much  as  the  Hiawatha parents? On the contrary, their effective tax rate was almost the same. But there is a dramatic difference. Charleston’s grand  list produces only $802 per  student,  compared with Essex  Junction’s $4,563, almost  six times greater. I ask you, is this fair? No, it is not. It is time for change. The level of contrast between these communities does not exist because people do not want the best for their children. These differences exist largely because people at the local level are basing their education decisions on how much money is available, which depends on the size of the grand list. The  growth  in  grand  list,  unfortunately,  does  not  follow  families.  In  fact,  it  might  be  argued,  it  detours families. Our  challenge  is  not  only  to  erase  geographic  limitations. We must make  the  State  of Vermont  a  showcase for excellence. We are the envy of the nation for our environmental quality and are known for our readiness to take up arms against  any  person  or  interest  who  would  despoil  our  environmental  heritage  for  purely  selfish  reasons.  I  dare say  there  is  no  one  in  this  room  this  afternoon  who  does  not  instinctively  understand  the  importance  of  the environmental imperative in Vermont. I ask you to seek and achieve educational excellence with the same zeal. Education has historically been government’s greatest responsibility and expenditure. The U.S. Supreme Court addressed this in its historic 1954 case on race discrimination: Brown v. the Board of Education. In a unanimous decision, the court wrote: “Compulsory  school  attendance  laws  and  the  great  expenditures  for  education  both  demonstrate  our recognition  of  the  importance  of  education  to  our  democratic  society.  It  is  required  in  the  performance  of  our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. In  these  days,  it  is  doubtful  that  any  child  may  reasonably  be  expected  to  succeed  in  life  if  he  is  denied  the opportunity for an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.” No one in this chamber disagrees with these words. But  let  us  examine  these  words  closely.  The  court  has  said:  “Education  is  a  right  which  must  be  made available to all on equal terms.” Our Vermont Constitution echoes this principle. In  Vermont,  we  have  said  “Yes”  in  theory,  but  “No”  in  practice  to  the  principle  of  equal  educational opportunity.  In  fact,  through  a  combination  of  ignorance,  market  forces,  and  allegiance  to  localism,  we  are fostering a dangerous policy of greater inequality of educational opportunity. The gap between rich and poor school districts is becoming wider each year. On  average,  the  grand  lists  in  Sherburne,  Stratton,  and  Stowe  grew  by  42  percent  between  1983  and  1985. But Bristol, Craftsbury and St. Albans City averaged only 5 percent growth  in  their grand  lists during  the same period. We  must  recognize  that  the  state  aid  solution  does  not  lie  in  any  particular  formula  alone.  There  are  no magic  formulas  waiting  to  be  discovered.  The  solution  lies  in  mustering  the  political  will  to  resolve  the contradiction  between  continued  local  funding  as  we  now  know  it,  and  equal  education  opportunity  for  all  of Vermont’s school children. The  time  has  come  to  recognize  that  if  the  principle  of  equal  educational  opportunities  is  to  be  honored  in practice, property  tax capacity,  the key factor which  influences  the quality of a child’s education, can no  longer be exclusively apportioned according to school district boundaries. We  must  muster  the  will  to  acknowledge  the  statewide  interests  of  education,  while  continuing  to  respect local values. I am aware of the arguments used to avoid this basic philosophical decision. Some  say  property  wealth  and  school  expenditures  do  not  guarantee  educational  excellence,  others  argue those  towns  that have  the wealth deserve  to keep  it because  they worked  to obtain  it, and  still others claim  that we  do  not  have  to  address  the  property  tax  question  as  long  as we  raise  funds  through  other  taxes  to  finance  a redistribution formula. All  those  arguments  contain  an  element of  truth, but  they do not  contain  enough  truth  to  solve  the problem we face nor do they give us an easy way out. There  are  not  any  comfortable,  incremental,  non-controversial ways  to  reach  the  goal we  espouse —  equal educational opportunity through equal spending and equal tax burdens. I  ask  you,  in  fact,  to  risk  discomfort,  to  seek  controversy,  and  to  take  bold  steps  to  achieve  success. Future Vermonters will thank you for it. Vermonters  have  been  willing  throughout  history  to  put  aside  parochial  interests  for  the  greater  benefit  of the state. It  took courage  to offer  the  first bond  issue  in our history  in  the aftermath of  the 1927  flood. This was a  momentous state initiative, considered perilous in its time. It  took  courage  for  Democrats  and  Republicans  to  work  for  reapportionment  in  1965.  Their  efforts  ended forever the long-cherished principle that every town could send one member to the House of Representatives. It  took courage, as many here will remember,  to abolish  the  local overseer of  the poor.  It was only 20 years ago that we created a new, humane, and progressive social service system. In each case, as a matter of conscience, we recognized that every Vermonter must be treated equally. Just as every Vermonter has equal  representation  in  this chamber because of  reapportionment, and every Vermonter  in need has  equal  access  to welfare benefits,  I  call  upon  you  to make  certain  that  every Vermont  school  child has access to an equal education. Through the anvil of compromise and bipartisanship, we can achieve a fundamental restructuring of the way we finance public education in Vermont. The task will not be easy. Many have tried before us. In the last 100 years there have been six different proposals to reform education financing. In the late 1800’s the Legislature first provided funds to assist school districts which paid teachers more than 15 dollars per week. In 1935, there was, as you might surmise, a study commission, which reported to the Governor. It stated that a school finance aid formula be based on a philosophy of equal educational opportunity for students “regardless of their locations in the state.” There once was, in fact, a statewide property tax in Vermont, and a foundation plan. Our task is not a new one, but in one sense, it is different. More than ever before, the times in which we live demand a higher and more sophisticated level of education than required of earlier generations of Vermonters. For  a  moment,  I  ask  you  to  personalize  the  principle  of  educational  opportunity  into  the  specifics  of  your own  life.  What  has  education,  or  in  some  cases,  the  lack  of  it,  meant  to  you?  What  do  you  wish  for  your children and grandchildren?  I know,  from my personal experience, what education has meant  to me. When  I came  to  this country as an immigrant,  with  my  brother  and  mother,  not  speaking  English,  it  was  the  educational  system  of  this  nation which opened every important door to us. Without it, we would have deprived ourselves of the upward mobility which  gave  every  immigrant  and  every  American,  no  matter  how  humble  his  or  her  beginnings,  the  genuine hope for a better life. Without access to education, the dream would have died. What was true for my brother and me, is true for the next generation of Vermonters. It must  also  be  recognized  that  regardless  of  the  allure  of  “local  control,”  the  phrase  turns  into  a  cruel  joke when all there is to control is continued poverty. It  is  genuine  local  control  to  say  that  our  schools  can  decide  how  to  use  the  funds  provided  them  to  design and implement local programs. But it is a perversion of local control to say that they must do so with inadequate funds because they don’t happen to have a mountain, lake, or large industry to bolster their tax base. In  the public hearings on  this  subject, we have heard much about  the price exacted by changing  the present system. There is, I strongly believe, a greater price to be paid by inaction. If we continue the present trend of permitting, in fact, encouraging the rich to get richer and the poor poorer, the inevitable result will be a greater number of high school dropouts, lower achievement scores, and decreased ability to compete worldwide. All those who fail in school will have to be supported, to one degree or another, by our tax dollars. That cost will  be  borne  to  a  large  extent  by  those  very  same  communities,  who  today  protest  sharing  any  percentage  of their tax resources with poorer communities. I  believe  it  is  a  question  of  invest  now  and  help  prevent  future  economic  dependency,  or  pay  later.  We cannot afford to institutionalize, through superior and inferior school systems, a two-tiered, two-class society in Vermont. Neither can we accept on moral grounds such economic injustice. Viewed in this light, education financing reform is the most significant economic and social issue facing this state. You  will  be  asked  as  you  debate  this  issue:  how  can  we  be  sure  that  spending  more  money  translates  into educational excellence? Today we have data which shows that Vermont’s best schools are located in the districts that spend the most per pupil and have the greatest property wealth. Let us compare Williamstown and Stowe. Williamstown High School sends 30 percent of its students to college, has a dropout rate of 5.8 percent, and meets 31 percent of the state standards. Stowe  High  school  sends  55  percent  of  its  children  to  college  and  has  a  dropout  rate  of  less  than  one percent. In fiscal year 1985, Williamstown had a tax rate of $1.80, and spent $2935 per pupil after receiving $589 in state aid. Stowe had a tax rate of 72 cents and spent $4801 per pupil, after receiving $100 per pupil, a floor town. Unquestionably different results, different spending, different tax burdens. It  is  fair  to  ask,  why  is  Vermont’s  problem  so  great?  The  reason  is  simple.  We  have  the  smallest  school districts in the nation with the greatest difference in property wealth of any state in the nation. Other  states  long  ago  addressed  this  problem  by  having  larger  school  districts,  so  that  the  benefits  of development are more widely shared.  Each  district  in  Vermont  averages  300  students.  In  New  Hampshire  the  average  is  1000  students.  The U.S. average is 2,500. Larger districts,  for  taxing purposes only,  is  an  issue  that must be  revisited.  I have  asked Senator Phil Hoff and  Elbert Moulton  to  chair  a  committee  to  recommend  more  equitable  districts,  a  task  Senator  Hoff  initiated during his term as governor. To guarantee  that Vermont does  indeed become a showcase for educational excellence, I have proposed  the following initiatives: — A report card for each school district, with input from a community advisory board. —Twenty new community-based early education programs for disadvantaged four-year-olds. — A  second-chance  program  to  reduce  the  dropout  rate  to  zero  in  five  years  and  bring  dropouts  back  into the school system. — A school improvement fund. — Regular school audits for all districts. — Regular evaluations of how school districts apportion spending between administration and teaching. — Establishment of a central purchasing system, anticipated to save more than three million dollars. I  deliberately  delayed  my  own  recommendation  on  state  aid  funding  until  the  commission,  created  by  the Legislature  last  year,  completed  its  task.  In  the  past  nine  months,  they  have  done  a  tremendous  amount  of diligent work on the state aid problem. I commend them for their effort and their commitment to the principle of equal education for all Vermont children. The time for study is over. Now is the time for action. Today,  I  seek  your  support  for  the  Vermont  Foundation  Plan,  as  developed  by  the  State  Aid  Commission. The Legislative Pages will put a detailed explanation of my proposal on your desks  immediately  following  this address. I will present you with legislation next week. The  Vermont  Foundation  Plan  has  many  advantages.  It  achieves  my  twin  objectives  of  education  and taxpayer equity. Simply  put,  each  school  district  will  be  guaranteed  the  financial  resources  to  provide  its  students  with  a good basic education at a reasonable property tax rate. A good basic education is one which fully meets the state school approval standards. This has been estimated at $3,400 per student. The  Vermont  Foundation  Plan  will  guarantee  each  district  the  capacity  to  raise  $3,400  per  student  at  an equalized tax rate no higher than $1.25. The fully-funded plan will cost approximately $120 million, $31 million above the current appropriation. I  also  propose  that  property-wealthy  communities  share  with  poorer  districts.  This  would  require communities  that  can  raise  the  $3,400  per  child  with  less  than  an  82  cent  equalized  tax  rate  to  assist  poorer districts. I  do  not  endorse  the  Commission’s  proposal  to  give  towns  the  local  option  to  raise  taxes.  This  provision would  be  a  significant  benefit  to  only  a  few  towns  and  simply  increase  the  unequal  tax  burdens  which  now exist. Most  significantly,  under  the  foundation  plan,  we  will  guarantee  that  no  person  shall  pay  more  than  five percent of his income in property taxes, regardless of income. I recommend that this plan be phased in over a five-year period. I  fully  recognize  that  the  task  I  have  placed  before  you  is  not  easy  to  achieve.  In  fact,  there  are many who will claim immediately after I conclude my remarks that it is impossible. We  cannot  afford  such  pessimism.  Nor  should  we  lower  our  sights  and  adjust  to  what  is  considered “politically  popular.”  The  children  of  Vermont  are  our  constituents,  and  it  is  to  them  we  are  ultimately responsible. The future of this state will be in their hands, and we are in a unique position to shape that future. I  tell  you  today  that  I will  continue  this  fight  until  it  is won.  I will  not  accept  the  status  quo.  I will  oppose efforts to simply extend the Morse-Giuliani formula. The  Morse-Giuliani  formula  was  an  important  step  in  its  time.  It  allowed  us  to  put  new  state  funds  into education  in  a more  equitable  way,  and  I  am  glad  we  did.  But  the  gap  in  resources  available  to  the  wealthiest districts and the poorest districts widened under Morse-Giuliani. There  is  another  critical  reason  why  Morse-Giuliani  is  inadequate  for  today’s  challenges.  Many communities do not have and will not be able to raise, without unacceptable pain, the funds necessary to comply with  the  school  approval  standards. Unless we  change  our  education  financing method, we will  be  called  upon to choose between repeal or dilution of the standards or a massive tax increase. If we abandon the standards, our generation says, in effect, to the next generation, we do not care about your future enough to provide you with a good basic education. The  Vermont  Foundation  Plan  offers  another  option  that  faces  squarely  the  needs  of  our  students  while being fair to our taxpayers. I will call upon the people of the state of Vermont, beyond the walls of this chamber, for help. Business  men  and  women,  farmers,  parents,  factory  workers  all  have  a  stake  in  the  outcome  of  your deliberations. This  is  an  issue,  above  all  others, which will  determine  the  future  business  climate  of  this  state,  and which will determine the future welfare of the people of this state. Think  for  a  moment,  how  will  we  introduce  good  high  technology  jobs  in  the  Northeast  Kingdom  if  we cannot support a first-rate school system in that region? The answer is obvious. What  is  required  of  us  is  more  than  a  formula  change.  It  is  an  act  of  moral  courage  which  reaffirms  our belief in the fundamental democratic principle of equal access to education. To  achieve  it,  join  me  in  seeing  beyond  the  bounds  of  your  own  legislative  district  and  recognize  the overarching responsibilities we have to all the people of this state. We can surmount our differences. We can work in concert, as Republicans and Democrats, for the common good. That is why we are here. We will freely and vigorously debate the pros and cons of this proposal. The final law will benefit from that exchange. But let us not disguise debate as action, nor permit ourselves to use complexity as an excuse for delay. I stated the problem at the outset. It is straightforward. In Vermont, the quality of education a child receives depends on where he or she resides. That is neither fair nor good for the future of our state. Our goal is clear: to remedy this inequity by restructuring the way education is financed in Vermont. The  charge  I  have  placed  before  you  is  worthy  of  your  total  dedication.  I  ask  for  yours,  and  pledge  you mine.  I  am determined  that we will  succeed,  and  as  a  result, we will be proud of our  lasting contribution  to  the people of this state. Thank you.
