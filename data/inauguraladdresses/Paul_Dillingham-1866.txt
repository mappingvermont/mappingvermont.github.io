Orders were  drawn  by me  on  the  State  Treasurer  from October  24th,  1865,  to  January  1st,  1866,  amounting to $7,669 51, which may be classified as follows: Services and expenses of recruiting officers, Services and expenses of arresting deserters, Defense of the frontier, State pay prior to muster, and pay of officers, $128 45 6 25 372 03 114 60         102 84 129 60 300 00 890 14 Expenses organizing State militia, Expenses of State military commission at Washington, Expenses of Adjutant and Inspector General’s office, Transportation of Vermont officers, soldiers, &c., Expenses of State Treasurer’s office, December 1, 1864,  to December 1, 1865, 5,625 60  Since  January  1,  1866,  all  orders  on  the  treasury  have  been  drawn  by  the  Auditor  of  Accounts,  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  act  approved  November  9,  1865,  entitled  “An  act  defining  the  duties  of certain State officers, and for the protection and benefit of the treasury.”  By  the  provision  of  the  same  act,  the  governor  of  the  State  was  relieved  of  all  care  and  responsibility relating  to  the  settlement  of  the  claims  of  this  State  against  the  United  States,  and  the  entire  duty  of  their adjustment  and  final  settlement  was  transferred  to  the  Auditor  of  Accounts,  to  whose  report  I  refer  you  for information on the subject of those claims, as well as for details of claims allowed by him against the State.  On the 31st of October, 1865, the Quartermaster General submitted to me the following schedule of military property belonging to the State, which he recommended should be sold, to wit: One telescope rifle, 1 target rifle, 1 coil lead pipe, 20 small tables, 87 chairs, 61 straw hats, 139 pairs cotton trowsers, 180 pairs overalls, 187 denim frocks, 28 grey coats, 243 bed sacks. I appointed a board of  survey  to examine  this property and on  their  report and  recommendation, on  the 14th day of November, 1865, ordered the Quartermaster General to sell the same at auction, which he afterwards did.  This property was old and had been more or less used. On  the  5th  day  of December,  1865,  the Quartermaster General  had  the  following  new  property  in  his  hands belonging to the State, to wit: Thirty-seven  hundred  wool  blankets,  2500  rubber  blankets,  1200  rubber  ponchos,  7776  canteens,  7776 haversacks, 1118 table knives, 1156 table forks, 575 tablespoons, 636 tin plates, 709 tin cups, 175 candle-sticks, 112  pepper-boxes,  which  he  recommended  to  have  sold,  for  the  reason,  that  it  was  almost  impossible  to preserve  the most of  it  from  injury,  if not destruction,  through a succession of summer,  that  it would be useless till wanted  for  the militia when  called  into  active  service,  and  that when,  if  ever,  such  an  event  should happen, similar property could probably be purchased in market for less than this would now sell for. On  this  application,  a  board  of  survey was  appointed,  composed  of C.C. Wilson, Colonel  4th Regiment Vt. State Militia, W.H.  Ballou,  Captain  4th  Regiment  Vt.  State Militia,  C.C.  Putnam  Jr.,  Captain  4th  Regiment  Vt. State  Militia,  who,  on  examining  said  property,  recommended  its  sale.    Their  report  was  confirmed,  and  the Quartermaster General authorized to sell the same, at such time or times as he saw fit, with directions to stop or suspend  the  sales  when,  in  his  opinion,  it  was  not  selling  at  remunerative  prices.    Under  these  orders  he  sold property  to  the  amount  of  $6,235  64,  when,  finding  that  the  United  States  were  selling  like  property,  in  very large quantities, all over the country, thereby depressing prices, he suspended further sales; but said order is still in force, and  the residue of  that property will be sold under it, during  the present fall and coming winter, unless the Legislature direct otherwise. STATE AID Hon.  John Howe,  Jr.,  agent  for  the  distribution  of  State  aid  to  soldiers’  families,  has made  his  final  report, showing  that,  from  September  1,  1865,  to  April  15,  1866,  he  disbursed,  under  the  acts  of  April  26,  1861,  and November 14, 1862,  the sum,  in all, of $582 18.   The agent states  that  there  is now no outstanding claim under either of those acts.  I herewith transmit said report. VOLUNTEER TROOPS. Since the last session of the Legislature,  the four companies of  the 9th Regiment and  the entire 7th Regiment of Vermont Volunteers have been mustered out in the state of Virginia, December 1, 1865, and the 7th Regiment at Brownsville, Texas, March 14, 1866.  From these points they returned to Vermont, where they were paid and 58 10,379 ------------   discharged.    Thus  all  the  obligations  of  Vermont,  in  connection  with  the  active  prosecution  of  the  war  for  the preservation  of  the Union,  have  been  performed,  and  all  the  organizations  sent  from  the State,  and which  have contributed  so  largely  to  its  reputation  and  honor,  and  to  the  final  success  of  the  national  arms  have  ceased  to exist  as  such,  and  the  officers  and  men  composing  them  have  laid  aside  their  arms,  assumed  the  garb  of  the citizen,  and have quietly mingled with  the mass of  the  community.   All honor  to  these noble men  that yet  live; all  respect,  undying  respect,  to  the  memories  of  the  fallen,  who  so  cheerfully  gave  their  own  lives  that  their country might continue to live! The original numbers that composed the different Vermont organizations for the war, were: 702  Officers, Enlisted men,  17,828 ----------     18,530 Gain. Appointed commissioned officers, Enlisted men,     Aggregate number, Loss. By promotions to U.S. A., Transfers to other organizations, Total by death Total by discharge, Deserted, Dropped from rolls, Not finally accounted for,    Total of loss (brought from preceding page), Mustered out of service, in all,     Aggregate, Veterans re-enlisted, Enlisted in the U.S. Navy, Army and Marine Corps, Drafted men, paid commutation,    Total number of men furnished by this State,  143 1,136 5,128 5,022 2,219 5 75 ------------ 10,437 ----------- 28,967 13,728 13,728 15,239 --------- 28,967 1,961 1,339 1,971 --------- 34,238          NORMAL AND COMMON SCHOOLS. For  many  years  there  has  been  an  increasing  strength  of  public  sentiment  in  this  State  favorable  to  the adoption  of  some  adequate  means  of  supplying  a  more  specific  course  of  instruction  for  the  teachers  of  our common schools.  This sentiment has increased very rapidly, and has become more and more defined within the past  few  years,  until  the  great  majority  of  thoughtful  friends  of  popular  education  seems  thoroughly  united  in desiring the establishment of some system of State normal instruction. The national troubles, and the very large expenditures induced thereby, have hitherto delayed any attempt to inaugurate such system as would respond  to  the general demand; for, while all have been united in opinion that we were  in  duty  bound  to  lose  nothing  of  the  ground  already  gained  in  the  field  of  educational  labor,  all  have equally  agreed  that  the  heavy  burden  of  our  taxes  rendered  it  unadvisable  to  undertake  any  new  enterprises, however  laudable,  which  must  necessarily  increase  so  largely  the  State  burdens,  as  would  be  done  by  the attempt to establish a system of State normal schools similar to those of some of our sister states. Within  the  last  year,  the  way  seems  to  have  been  opened  by  which  a  beginning  may  be  made  in  the accomplishment of  this  important work, and at very slight expense  to  the State.   The  trustees of Orange County Grammar  School  –  an  institution  of  established  character  –  have  proposed  to  the  Board  of  Education  to surrender up the use of their school property for a term of years, for the purpose of converting their school into a State Normal School;  the Board  of Education  to  establish  courses  of  study,  the  first  to  include  all  the  branches required  by  law  to  be  taught  in  the  common  schools,  and  the  second  to  be  more  rigid,  and  to  require  in  its mastery a year’s longer time; the board to determine the qualifications for admission to and graduation from the school,  and  to  attend,  by  its  agents,  upon  all  examinations,  and  decide  who  shall  be  allowed  to  enter  and  to graduate; the board to nominate the principal, and the trustees to engage as principal no other than some person so nominated by the board; the trustees to keep the school property in good repair, and to determine the rates of tuition and  receive  the  same  for  their own benefit; graduates  from  the  first   course  to  receive certificates which shall  inure  to  their  benefit,  as  qualifying  them  to  teach  in  any  common  school  in  the  State  for  five  years;  and graduates  from  the  higher  course  to  receive  credentials  which  shall  avail  them  as  perpetual  certificates.    This proposition  has  been  approved  by  the  Board  of  Education,  and  will  appear  at  length  in  the  report  of  their Secretary, and, at their request, I commend the subject to your careful consideration. I  recommend  the  enactment  of  a  law  by  which  the  Board  of  Education  may  be  empowered  to  accept  the proposition  referred  to,  and  also  to  accept,  in  their  discretion,  similar  propositions  from  other  schools  in different parts of the State, and to carry out the compacts that will result from such acceptances, by attending, in person  or  by  agents,  the  examinations  for  admission  to  and  graduation  from  any  schools  thus  adopted,  and granting to graduates the appropriate certificates. I desire also to commend to your attention the matter of the authorized list of school text-books, a somewhat extended  discussion  of  which  will  be  found  in  the  report  of  the  Board  of  Education  to  your  honorable  body.  The  original  selection  of  school  books was made  in  1859,  to  expire  in  1864;  but  the  time  originally  appointed for  its  duration  was  afterwards  extended  to  1867,  and  will  now  soon  expire.    This  plan  of  an  authoritative selection  of  school  books,  although  strongly  opposed  at  first,  seems  to  have  won  its  way  to  very  general approval. Some  legislation  at  your  present  session  will  be  necessary  to  prevent  a  return  to  an  unlimited  diversity  of books, that cannot but injure the schools; and I recommend that the Board of Education be empowered to revise the authorized list of school books, and publish the same as soon as maybe practicable, and that the authority of the present list be continued until such revision be made public. REFORM SCHOOL. Under  the  act  approved  November  9,  1865,  entitled  “An  act  to  establish  the  Vermont  Reform  School,”  I appointed,  by  and with  the  advice  of  the    Senate, Aaron G.  Pease  as  acting  commissioner,  and  Lewis A Dunn and  Lewis  Pratt  advisory  commissioners,  who  soon  afterwards  located  said  school  at  Waterbury,  Vt.;  and  in connection  with  said  location,  the  commissioners  purchased  about  sixty-seven  acres  of  land,  part  of  the  old Governor Butler farm, so called, taking a deed of the same to the State, at the price of six thousand two hundred dollars.    This  purchase  exceeded  by  two  hundred  dollars  the  sum  they  were  authorized  by  said  act  to  pay  for land.  They paid toward it six thousand dollars, and gave a guarantee to deed back one acre out of the south-east corner  of  the  land  purchased,  in  case  the  Legislature  at  its  present  session  should  fail  to  make  a  further appropriation  of  the  two  hundred  dollars.   The  land  purchased  had  large  and  valuable  buildings  on  it,  suited  to the wants  of  the  school,  and  though  the  commissioners were  unrestricted  in  the  amount  of  expense  in  erecting all  suitable  buildings  for  the  accommodation  of  said  school,  yet  as  these  building  came  with  the  land,  the restriction as  to  the  sum  to be paid  for  the  land, applied  to  the whole purchase.    I most heartily  recommend  the appropriation  of  the  remaining  two  hundred  dollars,  as  the  acre  to  be  conveyed  back  is worth much more  than that sum. Russell  Butler  is  the  owner  of  about  sixty-five  acres  of  land, which  adjoins  that  purchased  and  is  a  part  of the old Governor Butler  farm.   This he proposed  to  sell  to  the State as a part of  the Reform School  farm, at  the price of four thousand two hundred dollars, and he gave a bond to convey it at that price, should the Legislature at  the present session appropriate money for  its purchase.   This  land  is richly worth  the price asked, and would, in my opinion, be a very judicious purchase for the State, as it seems really necessary in order to constitute such a farm as the school needs; and should be present opportunity to purchase it be neglected, I do not think it could ever  again  be  obtained  at  anything  like  the  price  now  asked.    I  therefore  recommend  an  appropriation  for  its purchase at the price named. The  buildings  purchased  have  been  repaired  and  enlarged  so  as  to  accommodate  from  twenty-five  to  thirty scholars and the school is now open for the reception of juvenile offenders, quite a number having already been received; and I think it gives good promise of accomplishing all that the State expects from such an institution. The first report of  the commissioners has been made  to me, and I have caused  the same  to be printed, ready for immediate distribution.  I commend its suggestions and recommendations to your careful consideration. FISHING REGULATIONS IN LAKE CHAMPLAIN. Pursuant  to  the  act  of  the General Assembly,  entitled  “An  act  to  prevent  taking  shad  or white-fish  in  Lake Champlain  or  its  tributaries,”  approved  November  6,  1865,  I  caused  copies  thereof  to  be  forwarded  to  the governor-general of Canada, and the governor of New York, with the request that “their respective governments adopt  like measures  prohibiting  the  taking,  killing,  or  destroying  of  shad  or white-fish  in  the  parts  of  said  lake within their respective jurisdiction.”  The subject was taken into consideration with promptness and courtesy by the  government  of  Canada,  and  on  the  13th  day  of  April,  1866,  the  following  regulation  was  approved  by  the governor-general  in  council,  under  the  Canadian  fishery  act,  viz:    “No  person  shall,  during  the  months  of September,  October  and  November,  take,  kill,  or  destroy  any  shad  or  white-fish  in  the  waters  of  that  part  of Lake Champlain  situated within  the Province  of Canada.”   A  communication  from  the  governor  of New York, of May 19th, 1866, informed me that early in the session of the legislature of that state, he sent a copy of said act to  that  body,  and  by  special  message  called  their  attention  to  the  law  passed  by  the  General  Assembly  of Vermont, and urged upon them the importance of a similar enactment on their part, but that, owing to a press of other business,  the  legislature  adjourned without  final  action  thereon.   The  act of  this State,  is,  therefore, by  its terms, still inoperative. RESTORATION OF SEA-FISH TO THE CONNECTICUT RIVER. Under  the  joint  resolution  of  the  last  session  of  the Legislature,  relative  to  the  restoration  of  sea-fish  to  the Connecticut  river  and  its  tributaries,  I  appointed  Albert  D.  Hager,  State  Geologist,  and  Hon.  Charles  Barrett, Commissioners.    I  also  communicated  copies  of  said  joint  resolution  to  the  governors  of  Massachusetts,  New Hampshire and Connecticut.  The Commissioners’ report may be expected during your present session. Under  another  joint  resolution  of  the  last  session,  relating  to  the  improvident  destruction  of  shad  in  the Connecticut  river,  I  addressed  a  communication  to  the  governor  of  Connecticut,  requesting  him  to  call  the attention  of  the  legislature  of  that  state,  then  in  session,  to  the  subject  and  to  the  resolution  of  our  State,  a verified  copy  of  which  I  transmitted  to  him.    I  also  transmitted  copies  of  the  same  to  the  governors  of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.   In response  to  the application made  to  the state of Connecticut, I herewith transmit  to  you  the  certified  copy  of  a  joint  resolution,  passed  by  the  legislature  of  that  state  at  its  last  session, showing their willingness to co-operate with the other states in interest in the restoration of shad to the waters of the Connecticut. NATIONAL STATUARY HALL. Under  the  joint  resolution  of  the  Legislature  relating  to  the  National  Statuary  Hall,  adopted  at  its  last session,  I at an early day  appointed Hon. Solomon Foot and Hon.  Justin S. Morrill, Commissioners  to examine the  subject,  so  far  as  it  relates  to  this  State,  and  to  make  report  to  the  present  session,  with  such  facts  and suggestions  as  would  enable  you  to  take  definite  action  in  the  matter.    After  the  death  of  Senator  Foot,  I appointed  the Hon. George  F. Edmunds, Commissioner  to  act with Mr. Morrill  in  the  premises.   A  report may be expected from these gentlemen soon.  PARIS EXHIBITION. I am advised  that our  state Geologist, Albert D. Hager,  intends going  to Europe next  season, mainly  for  the purpose  of  learning  more  of  the  coal  mines  of  Newcastle,  the  copper  mines  of  Cornwall,  the  slate  quarries  of Wales,  the  silver  mines  of  Germany,  and  the  marble  quarries  of  Italy.    Should  the  Legislature  authorize  the Governor,  without  expense  to  the  State,  to  commission  Mr.  Hager  as  State  Agent  to  the  Paris  Exhibition  in 1867,  it  would  give  him  the  benefit  in  his  travels  in  the  rest  of  Europe,  of  those  courtesies  and  facilities  for obtaining all desirable information, which are sure to be extended to one being a commissioner from the United State,  or  from  a  state  of  the Union.   The  information  gathered  by Mr. Hager would undoubtedly be of value  in the development of the mineral wealth of this State. UNITED STATES SENATORS. The  last  Legislature  adjourned  on  the  10th  day  of  November,  1865,  at  8  o’clock  A.M.    Within  an  hour afterwards  intelligence  was  received  that  Hon.  Jacob  Collamer,  Senator  from  this  State  in  the  Congress  of  the United States, died at his residence in Woodstock during the preceding night.  Was the vacancy thus created one which  it was  the duty of  the Governor of  the State  to  fill?    I at once submitted  the question  to  the Judges of  the Supreme  Court,  who,  after  consideration,  gave  me  their  opinion  in  writing,  holding  that  the  facts,  as  above stated, constituted such a vacancy as the Constitution made it the duty of the Governor to fill.  Subsequently, on the 21st day of November, 1865, I appointed Hon. Luke P. Poland, of St. Johnsbury, a Senator from this State in the Congress of the United States, to fill the aforesaid vacancy until the next meeting of the General assembly of this State. On  the  28th  day  of March  last,  Hon.  Solomon  Foot,  Senator  from  this  State  in  the  Congress  of  the  United Stated died  at Washington,  in  the District of Columbia. On  the 3d day of April, 1866,  I  filled  the vacancy  thus occasioned by appointed Hon. George F. Edmunds, of Burlington Senator from this State in the Congress of the United States until the meeting of the General Assembly of this State. The  loss  of  both  her  Senators  within  so  brief  a  period  was  a  calamity  unprecedented  in  the  history  of Vermont – unprecedented in the history of any of her sister states.  Their long experience distinguished services, their  rare  ability  and  ripe wisdom,  their  tried  and  unfailing  constancy  to  duty  and  fidelity  to  state  and  country, their Christian purity and nobility of character, had won for them the foremost rank in the councils of the nation.  In  the  fullness  of  their  great  usefulness  and  influence,  at  a  time when  the  need  of  the  nation  cried  out  for  their continuance among us,  they were, by  the decrees of an  inscrutable but  just Providence called hence.   Their  loss seems irreparable.  Vermont doubly honored by their lives, weeps over their fresh graves and the nation mourns with  her.    The  never-fading  record  of  their  lives  remain  a  rich  legacy  to  their  State,  a  guiding  light  upon  the pathway of their successors, an inspiration to all. JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT. Hon. Luke P. Poland, having on the 21st day of November, 1865, received the appointment of United States Senator from this State, resigned the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Vermont, to which  he had then  recently  been  elected.   The  vacancy  occasioned  by  this  resignation,  I  on  the  30th  day  of November,  1865, filled  by  appointing  Hon.  John  Pierpoint,  of  Vergennes,  to  be  Chief  Justice  of  said  Court  until  the  then  next meeting of  the General Assembly.   On  the  same day  I  also  appointed,  for  the  same period of  time, Hon.  James Barrett,  of Woodstock  to  be  first  Assistant  Justice,  Hon.  Loyal  C.  Kellogg,  of  Rutland,  to  be  second  Assistant Justice,  Hon.  Asahel  Peck,  of  Burlington,  to  be  Third  Assistant  Justice,  and  Hon.  William  C.  Wilson,  of Bakersfield,  to be Fourth Assistant Justice of Said Court;  thus  leaving a vacancy  in  the office of Fifth Assistant Justice:    and  on  the  same  day  I  appointed  Hon.  Benjamin  H.  Steele,  of  Derby,  Fifth  Assistant  Justice  of  said Court, to fill said vacancy until the meeting of the General Assembly. STATE OF THE COUNTRY. Since  my  last  annual  communication  to  the  Legislature,  the  work  of  reconstructing  and  reorganizing  the state and local governments, which, for more than four years, had been in rebellion against the federal authority, has  largely engaged  the attention of  the executive and  legislative departments of  the General Government; and, as  is both necessary and wise  in a  republic  in which  the citizens are  sovereign and  the  source of all power,  this work  has  commanded  the  interested  and  intelligent  observation  and  criticism  of  the  whole  people  of  the country. Unhappily  for  the  best  solution  of  this  problem  of  reorganization,  the  national  executive  and  the  national legislature have not been in accord in their views of the best method of restoring these insurgent communities to their    true  relations  to  the  federal  Government;  and  the  work  has  thereby  been  much  delayed,  the  difficulties which  environ  it  have  been  much  increased,  and  the  southern  communities  have  become  much  more  hostile than at  first  to  the demands of  that wise policy which would  render “treason odious,” obtain ample  security  for the  future, and enable  the Government  to  redeem every pledge  it has made  to  its creditors,  to  its  friends, and  to the race which it has emancipated. The  executive branch of  the Government, having  inaugurated  the work of  reorganizing  the  rebellious  states without seeking the advice or co-operation of Congress, has continued to insist upon its exclusive control of the work, and has denied to the legislative branch of the Government any share in the determination of the status of the  insurgent  communities,  or  the  conditions  of  their  restoration;  and  while  denying  to  Congress  all  right  to judge of  the completeness of  this work of  reorganization,  it has conceded only  the right of each House  to  judge of  the elections,  returns and qualifications of  its own members.   This policy assumes  that  the Executive has  the sole  right  to  reconstruct,  reorganize  and  restore  to  their  former  condition  in  the  Government,  the  people communities and states which have waged a gigantic war against  that government; and  it  insists, with emphatic iteration,  that  Congress,  by  refusing  to  recognize  the  executive  reconstruction  as  just,  safe,  complete  and constitutional, and at once admitting to seats in the Senate and House of Representatives persons claiming to be elected  by  states  thus  reorganized,  is  assuming  functions which  do  not  belong  to  it  infracting  the Constitution, and attempting, with a guilt equal to that of the rebellion, to dismember the Union. On the assembling of Congress in December last, and throughout its last session, that body claimed for itself the  constitutional  right  to  examine  this  work  of  reconstruction,  and  judge  both  of  its  conditions  and completeness.   After  a  careful  and  prolonged  investigation,  through  its  joint  committee  on  the  construction,  of the  condition  of  the  states  lately  in  rebellion,  the  disposition  of  their  inhabitants,  and  the  workings  and  results  of  the executive method of  reorganization,  it was  fully satisfied  that  the political and civil power  in  those states was,  in almost every  instance, placed  in  the hands of those who, during  the rebellion, were either active  in  their hostility to the national Government, or gave aid and comfort to its enemies; while it was apparent that, without further  conditions  that  the  executive  plan  proposed,  those  who  had  been  during  the  rebellion  the  bitterest enemies  of  the  national  authority,  would  have  the  unchecked  and  entire  political  control  of  those  states  in  the future,  and  would  use  that  control  to  oppress  and  put  under  ban  those  who  have  never  swerved  from  their fidelity to the Union. Congress,  therefore,  wisely  in  my  judgment,  declined  to  treat  the  states  which  had  confederated  in  their treason against  the Government, as  rightfully entitled  to  immediate  representation  in  the national  legislature, or to  be  released  from  the  control  of  the  federal  authority;  and  this  decision  was  evidently  in  agreement  with  the opinions  of  a  large  majority  of  the  people  who  had  heartily  sustained  the  Government  in  its  contest  with  the rebellion. To  the  reading  and  thinking  people  of  the  nation,  who  judge  by  facts  and  results  rather  than  by  the refinements of argument, the riots at Memphis and New Orleans have furnished the most complete and startling evidence  of  the  inherent  error  of  the  executive  scheme,  and  have  written  its  condemnation  in  characters  of blood.    In  those  riots  peaceable  citizens,  with  circumstances  of  savage  atrocity,  were  cruelly  murdered  by  a mob,  incited  and  led by  local officials,  and  inspired by  an  illiberal  and  intense  prejudice  against  an  inoffensive race, and by a vengeful hatred of those who dared to claim equal political and civil rights for all men; and these outbreaks  have  furnished melancholy  proof  of  the  danger  of  committing  unrestrained  political  and  civil  power to    men  recently  rebels,  and  are  significant  commentaries  upon  that  reorganization  of  which  they  were  the legitimate fruits. Congress,  however,  did  not  insist  upon  its  constitutional  right  to  inaugurate  the  work  of  reorganizing  the governments  of  the  states  which  had  confederated  in  rebellion,  nor  did  it  surrender  that  right,  but  in  its legislative action it manifested a willingness to suffer the work of the Executive to remain undisturbed, so far as it could do so with due respect to the dignity and safety of the republic, and with a proper regard to the security and protection of the property, liberty and lives of all the people of the United States. After a laborious and extended session and a patient comparison of views, both Houses  of Congress agreed, by the necessary two-thirds vote, to propose to the legislatures of the several states the following amendment  to the federal Constitution: A M E N D M E N T .  ARTICLE  XIV. SEC. 1.   All persons born or naturalized  in  the United States  and  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  thereof,  are  citizens of  the United  States  and  of  the  state  wherein  they  reside.    No  state  shall  make  or  enforce  any  law  which  shall  abridge  the privileges or  immunities of citizens of  the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of  life,  liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws SEC. 2.   Representative shall be apportioned among  the several states according  to  their  respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.  But when the right to vote at any election for the choice  of  electors  for  President  and  Vice  President  of  the  United  States,  Representatives  in  Congress,  the  executive  and judicial officers of a state, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state, being  twenty-one  years  of  age  and  citizens  of  the  United  States,  or  in  any  way  abridged,  except  for  participation  in rebellion  or  other  crime,  the  basis  of  representation  therein  shall  be  reduced  in  the  proportion which  the  number  of  such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such state. SEC.  3.    No  person  shall  be  a  Senator  or  Representative  in  Congress,  or  elector  of  President  and  Vice  President,  or hold  any  office,  civil  or  military,  under  the  United  States,  or  under  any  state,  who,  having  previously  taken  an  oath  as member  of  Congress,  or  as  an  officer  of  the  United  States  or  as  a member  of  any  state  legislature,  or  as  an  executive  or judicial office of any state,  to support  the Constitution of  the United State, shall have engaged  in  insurrection or  rebellion against  the  same,  or  given  aid  or  comfort  to  the  enemies  thereof.    But  Congress  may,  by  a  vote  of  two-thirds  of  each house, remove such disability. SEC. 4. The validity of the pubic debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.  But neither the United States  nor  any  state  shall  assume  or  pay  any  debt  or  obligation  incurred  in  aid  of  insurrection  or  rebellion  against  the United  States,  or  any  claim  for  the  loss  or  emancipation  of  any  slave;  but  all  such  debts,  obligations,  and  claims  shall  be held illegal and void. SEC. 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Soon  after  this  proposed  amendment  was  adopted,  it  was  ratified  by  the  legislature  of  Tennessee,  and  immediately thereupon  the  senators  and  representative  previously  chosen  by  that  state,  upon  taking  the  oaths  prescribed  by  law, were admitted to seats in the respective Houses of Congress. Texas is the only other state confederated in the rebellion, that has acted upon this amendment.  There it was rejected, the legislature directing the committee having it in charge to return it to the Secretary of State. Every  other  state  –  except  Oregon,  whose  legislature  first  ratified  and  then  rejected  it  –  which  stood  by  the Government during the rebellion, whose legislature has been in session since the amendment was proposed, has ratified it; and there is good reason to confidently anticipate that it will be ratified by the number of states necessary to make it a part of the federal Constitution. While  this  amendment  does  not  contain  a  single  proposition  which  the  Executive  has  not,  either  in  his  speeches  or official communications, approved, its only danger of defeat – a danger now happily small – arises from his hostility to its ratification. The  issue presented  to  the people  this  fall has been  and will be  this policy of Congress,  as  contrasted with  that of  the Executive  Department  of  the  Government.    The  former  puts  such  safeguards  about  the  restoration  of  the  states  lately confederated  in  rebellion  to  an  equal  participation  in  the  Government  with  the  state  which  always  remained  true  to  the flag, as shall secure to the original Union men of the south equal rights and impartial liberty, while it stamps upon treason the  indelible mark of  the people’s condemnation.   The  latter  restores  to civil and political power  the men who plotted  the rebellion  and  fought  it  through  to  its  bitter  end,  leaving  to  their  unappeased  and  unrelenting  hate  a minority  of whites  so small  as  to be helpless, and  the entire colored  race,  to whom  liberty has been given, and  its peaceable and  full enjoyment guaranteed. The  elections  already  held  have  resulted  in  the  triumphant  approval  of  the  Congressional  policy;  and  there  is  no reasonable  doubt  that  the  elections  yet  to  be  held  will  pronounce  as  unmistakably  in  favor  of  the  constitutional amendment. Vermont, as  is her wont when called  to any good work,  led the way with a grand emphasis  in  the popular approval of Congress.   Yet, decisive as her declaration was at  the polls,  the State would have welcomed, with still greater enthusiasm and  with  a  more  triumphant  majority,  such  a  reorganization  of  the  rebellious  communities,  as  would  have  given  to  the people,  white  and  black,  the  equal  civil  and  political  rights  secured  to  the  people  of  this  state  by  our  Bill  of  Rights  and Constitution,  and  under which  peace,  order,  civilization,  education,  contentment,  Christianity  and  liberty  have  shed  their benign and blessed influence alike upon ever home and household in our beloved Commonwealth.  I invoke upon you, and your labors, the blessing of that God who has hitherto so graciously led an upheld us as a State and people. } PAUL DILLINGHAM.
