Inaugural address  of  Thomas P. Salmon  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1973     Thursday, January 4, 1973. Inaugural Address Mr.  President,  Mr.  Speaker,  Reverend  Clergy,  Mr.  President  Pro  Tern,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  Associate Justices  of  our  Supreme  Court.  Governor  Davis,  Governor  Hoff, members  of  this  Joint  General  Assembly; fellow Vermonters and friends. I have taken the oath of office as Governor in your presence as a sign of my covenant with you and with Almighty  God  to  uphold  our  Constitution,  to  be  true  and  faithful  to  the  State  of  Vermont,  to  carry  out  his laws and to do equal right and justice to all. The  trust  to  which  I  am  summoned  by  the  choice  of  a  free  people  is  so  awesome  an  undertaking  as  to change vanity into humility and pride into prayer. Permit  me  then,  as  my  first  executive  act,  to  ask  you  to  bow  your  heads  as  I  repeat  a  prayer,  which, twenty  years  ago  this  very  month,  President  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower  uttered  on  the  steps  of  our  Nations Capitol. “Almighty  God,  as  we  stand  here  at  this  moment,  my  future  associates  in  the  Executive  Branch  of Government join me in beseeching that thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng and their fellow citizens everywhere. “Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow our words and actions to be governed  thereby,  and  by  the  laws  of  this  land.  Especially  we  pray  that  our  concern  shall  be  for  all  the people regardless of station, race or calling. “May  cooperation  be  permitted  and  be  the  mutual  aim  of  those  who,  under  the  concepts  of  our Constitution  hold  to  differing  political  faiths;  so  that  all may work  for  the  good  of  our  beloved  country  and thy glory. Amen” In  this  chamber  of  so  many,  many  pleasant  memories,  where  I  was  privileged  to  serve  four  terms, mindful of my shortcomings as well as my strengths . . . I answer your call to service with an eager heart. This  is not a day of partisan celebration.  It  is a day of dedication and consecration  .  .  . a day  to examine what it is we are and what we hope to be. This much we know, that gathered within the borders of Vermont is something truly unique. Some say it is  the majesty  of  our  snow-capped mountains;  the  crisp  greenness  of  summer’s  forests  and meadows  or  the golden  red of  the hills when  autumn  comes. Others  say  that  is a way of  life, a way of  looking at  things. All these are a part of the magic that is Vermont. But, what is more, Vermont represents a soaring triumph of the human spirit. No  matter  how  severe  the  cold  or  how  long  absent  the  sun  or  how  rocky  the  soil,  Vermonters  have persevered  in  their  art  and  their  labor.  They  have  not  only  endured;  they  have  created,  and  man  is  a  little freer, a little more noble because of it.  Let those who do not understand us quickly come to know that we are the heirs of that resolute spirit . . . the trustees of Vermont’s air, earth and water . . . our environmental heritage . . . for generations yet to come and we shall not betray nor allow others to betray our birthright and our trust. Governor  Davis,  we  will  always  be  indebted  for  your  tireless  efforts  in  the  field  of  environmental conservation.  To  secure  your  place  in  history,  we  pledge  to  continue  the  great  legacy  you  have  left  us.  I know  I  speak  for  all  the people of  the State of Vermont when  I  say we wish you  and Mrs. Davis Godspeed as you leave State Government. Today marks an ending and a beginning to the course of State government. Let us chart this new course, mindful of the past but with an abiding faith in the future of our State based upon the strengths of our people and their demands for high standards of performance. Let us begin by stating some basic beliefs. I believe that the bedrock of all legitimate authority is the free consent of the people and that you cannot exclude the people from their own government. For if their informed discretion is not allowed to govern then surely their ignorance will.   Let  it  be  known,  then  that  we  seek  no  government  by  fiat  but  an  open  administration,  openly  attained committed always to fundamental proposition of the dignity and integrity of the individual. I  would  have  us  raise  patriotism,  a  genuine  not  a  spurious  love  of  state  and  country  to  its  ancient  and honorable level. I would have us lower the din of partisan and party strife so that we can hear the people speak. We might just learn something. In  recent  months  I  put  before  the  people  of  our  State  an  underlying  theme  entitled  “Vermont  for Vermonters.” By this theme I did not mean that we are a state made up of recluses. I tried to give voice the alarm of most Vermonters as they witness the wholesale assault on our land from without. Our  neighbors  unable  to  resist  the  promise  of  development  have  been  shortsighted  on  the  problems development brings. They are now paying the Price. Together  we  can  eliminate  many  of  the  problems  that  have  made  some  of  our  neighboring  states practically  ungovernable,  for  uncontrolled  growth  without  planning  results  in  burdening  our  local communities with problems that threaten their very existence and our individual destinies. Let us  tell  the developers who are not  interested  in profiting Vermont, but making Vermont profit  them, what I told them six months ago: “We are not going to change our laws. . .  “They are going to have to change their ways.” Let us tell them, and let us tell the rest of the country right here and now: “Vermont is not for sale!!” Let me  say  that Act  250  is  just  a  start. We must  strengthen  these  laws  and  I  call  upon  every Vermonter who wants  to  continue  to hunt,  fish,  ski, hike  and  snowmobile  to  join with us  in our  efforts  to protect  these precious open lands. Let me  say  departing  from my  text, Governor Davis,  just  last  night,  finding  very  little  to  do,  I  did  do  a cursory  reading  of  the  Land  Use  and  Capability  Plan,  hot  off  the  press.  Let  me  say  that  I  was  deeply impressed  with  the  tone  of  this  document,  which  appears  to  give  in  your  words  to  the  General  Assembly early  this  morning,  a  real  and  a  positive  sense  of  direction  to  our  environmental  mission.  I  will  attempt  to pick up where you left off. For years we have been promoting Vermont as the beckoning country. Would you believe . . . Vermont has been discovered? Many people in surrounding states would like to live and work and play in Vermont. The  tourist  industry  has  been  good  to  us.  It  raises  important  revenues  to  support  our  needs.  It  will  be encouraged. But  the  opportunities  for  living  and  working  in  job-scarce  Vermont  should  be  geared  to  our  present population. Many Vermonters  are  forced  to  live  in  substandard  housing while  a  proliferation  of  chalets  and condominiums are being built to satisfy the needs of visitors seeking second homes, and this is unacceptable and we’re going to do something about it. When I began my campaign last summer. . . I did one thing which, more than any other . . . helped bring me before you today. I  listened.  I  traveled  around  this  State  and  listened  to  what  our  people  were  saying,  and  I  based  my campaign on what they were saying. I  did  so  because  I  believe  that  no  less  important  than  the  citizen’s  right  to  speak  is  the  office  holder’s duty to listen. When  I  listened—do  you  know what  I  heard?  I  heard  that  the  people want  property  tax  relief  now,  not   two or three years from now, because in some cases it is already too late. We  have  lost  homesteads,  farms  and  open  lands  to  speculators  because  of  intolerable  pressure  in  the form of spiraling taxes. We must,  in my  judgment,  relate our property  tax  to ability  to pay and use our  revenue  sharing  funds  to provide  direct  tax  relief  to  our  citizens  while  embarking  on  new  and  innovative  approaches  to  correcting present inequities. We will exact a high price from those who would place our heritage on the auction block. My  tax  relief  bill  has  already  been  distributed  to  all  of  you,  and  it  differs  little  from  the  proposal  I  put before our people during the campaign. If we  enact  this property  tax  relief plan during  this  session of  the Legislature we will have  achieved  the major task Vermonters have given us. To those who would inquire as to our attitude toward human needs and financial matters we say: The  new  leadership  will  be  both  humanely  and  fiscally  responsive  which  will  become  apparent  as  the executive budget unfolds. Let us together perform the people’s business with a minimum of partisan conflict. The door to the Governor’s office is open to all Legislators on both sides of the political aisle. In closing, let me say: I have taken the oath of office today with my hand placed on the verse in the Holy Bible which asks: “What  doth  the  Lord  require  of  thee  but  to  do  justly,  and  to  love  mercy,  and  to  walk  humbly  with  thy God?” This much I pledge to you the people of Vermont. REMARKS FROM THE CHAIR Governor  Salmon,  we  have  heard  your  fair  and  generous  words  and  will  heed  them.  Speaking  through the  General  Assembly  for  the  people  of  Vermont,  I  say  that  we  stand  ready  to  serve  the  people  with  you from this moment forward.

DISSOLUTION The Governor, having completed the reading of his message, was escorted to the Executive Chamber by the Committee. The Supreme Court was escorted from the Hall by the Sergeant at Arms.
