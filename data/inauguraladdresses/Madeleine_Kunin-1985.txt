Inaugural address of  Madeleine M. Kunin  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1985   Thursday, January 10, 1985 Inaugural Address Mr. President, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the General Assembly and Friends: As I stand here before you — the solemn words of the Oath of Office echoing still in my mind — we know that we have opened another chapter in the proud and independent history of the Green Mountain State. I  am  the  first  woman  to  serve  as  Governor  of  Vermont,  the  third  Democrat  since  the  Civil  War  and  the second Governor of European birth. But I do not stand here alone. I  stand with my husband and children, with members of my  family who are a  source of my  strength — and my joy. Their love and support are essential to me. I  stand with  the memory of members of my  family who are no  longer with me — my mother, my aunt, my grandmother —  the  strong women who  could never have dreamt  I would be  in  this place on  this day, but who, through the courage of their own lives, give me the stamina to stand as tall as they did in their time. It was my mother, who as a widow, came to America from Switzerland with two small children, aged 6 and 10, in 1940, as war was spreading over Europe. In addition to a limited knowledge of English, she carried with her to these shores a limitless dream of what this country could offer her and her children. And she talked to us about the dream, but it was not until many years later, that I fully understood her. Her dream enabled me to strive, to reach, and to touch some horizons I was certain were beyond my grasp. — That dream must continue to beckon to the next generation. I  thank  this  country,  which  welcomed  me  here,  greeted  by  the  Statue  of  Liberty,  which,  despite  layers  of scaffolding,  continues  to  send  a  message  of  hope,  just  as  it  once  did  for  us,  and  for  the  generations  of  Irish, Italians,  Polish,  French,  and Canadians, who  came  to work  in  the  granite  sheds, woolen mills,  railroads,  farms and factories of Vermont. My immigrant roots, while more recent than most, are not extraordinary. It  is  that  immigrant spirit of hope which  I wish  to bring  to state government — a  spirit which  instills  in our children  the  belief  that  anyone  can  achieve  anything  in  this  country  with  hard  work,  an  education,  and  a  fair chance. It doesn’t matter where you came from. It matters where you are going. That  has  been  the  unique  opportunity  offered  by  our  country  and  by  our  state.  And  our  system  of government has been specifically designed to help bring that about. We have not accepted for ourselves the harsh theory of “Survival of the Fittest.” Social Darwinism was specifically rejected in the years of this country’s evolution when we opted for public education, for public health programs, for social security and unemployment compensation. But  the  debate  about  the  proper  role  of  government,  which  was  lively  at  the  time  our  Constitution  was framed, has in fact become more vigorous today. How much are we our brother and sister’s keeper? It is a question which we must ask of ourselves, and then, answer through our public policy decisions. From my  personal  experience,  I  believe  that  because  this  nation  has  been  generous  to me,  in  providing me with a public education, with opportunity to achieve my potential, that I have something to give back. We all have something to give back. And what we can give, is the same chance that we were given. There are many Vermonters who are waiting for that chance. For some it is a second chance. A second chance to get an education. A second chance to get off  welfare.  A chance to obtain child care, a chance for job training. We  know  that  for  each  generation  it  must  be  different.    In  the  60’s,  it  was  thought  that  government  could solve  any  social  problem  as  long  as  there  was  money  enough  to  do  it.  These  beliefs  must  be  tempered,  re-examined, and in some cases, set aside. In 1985, we must do it our way. And our way has to be more selective, more creative. We  know  today  that  for  people  to  be  given  a  second  chance  in  life,  they  have  to  fully  participate  in  the process and work for success, instead of merely being on the receiving end of public generosity. And we know that the private sector must also be involved. Government cannot do it alone. But we also know, just as I did as a child, that what this nation must continue to offer to the next generation, is both hope and opportunity. Without both, we not only deny the next generation a chance to reach its full height and breadth, but we also deny ourselves our own humanity. As  the  first woman  to  take  the Oath  of Office  of Governor  of  the  State  of Vermont,  I  recognize  that  I was able  to  raise  my  right  hand  before  you  this  afternoon,  only  because  so  many  women  had  raised  their  voices, long before my words were spoken. It was Susan B. Anthony, after all, who told us, “Failure is Impossible.” And  if  we  listen,  we  can  hear  the  voices  of  Vermont  farm  women,  who  in  the  pioneer  days  of  this  state, worked the soil with rough red hands, alongside the men who cleared the land. I stand here because of the women who worked in the mills in Winooski, who taught in the one-room school houses in Alburg, and who entered this Hall of Representatives in Montpelier before me. Clarina Howard Nichols,  the  first woman  to  speak  in  this Chamber,  grew  faint  from  fright when  she  spoke in favor of a bill which would have given women the right to vote in school district meetings in 1852. It was Edna L. Beard,  from Orange, whose portrait hangs outside  these doors, who became  the  first woman to be elected  to  the House of Representatives  in 1921. Peals of  laughter  rose  from  the  floor when  finally a man found the courage to take the seat next to hers. She was alone. I am not. I,  and  the  44  women  in  the  House  and  4  women  in  the  Senate,  stand  here  in  the  shadow  of  Consuelo Northrop  Bailey,  the  only  woman  to  become  Speaker  of  the  House,  and  the  first  to  be  elected  Lieutenant Governor. We all paved the way for one another, knowingly and unknowingly. As a Democrat, I have a special bond with  the  two Democratic Governors who are here, Philip H. Hoff and Thomas P. Salmon. Both served this state with distinction. As  I  stand  here  before  you  as  your  new  Governor,  I  walk  in  the  path  charted  for  the  last  eight  years  by Governor Richard A. Snelling — a man who has shown both strength and courage in leading us. I will build on his foundation. We all step on ground  that has been walked before, even as we make our own  imprints, as  I  intend  to make mine. I  stand  here  today,  not  only  because  of  the  Vermont  men  and  women  who  paved  the  way  for  my  own election, but also because of the 233,753 Vermonters who went to the polls last November. Once again, we showed our fine independent spirit. Regardless of the tide, we set our own course, as Vermonters have always done. And now we must ask: What are our expectations for the next two years? What is my mandate as your Governor? That today, is my task to define. I have four goals: — A strong economy, — A first-rate education system, — Property tax relief, — And a clean and healthy environment. In  order  to  achieve  these  goals,  we  must  add  a  fifth  objective  —  to  retain  and  strengthen  our  faith  in government itself by making Vermont government both more open and more responsive. Vermonters always have had faith in our ability to govern ourselves. We continue to believe that government can and must be a force for good. We know that state government must take a leadership role to get the job done. There is a difference between a Vermonter’s view of Montpelier and the national view of Washington. In Vermont, government is not “they”. It is “us”. Because we  are  small, we meet  one  another  on  the main  street  of  our  towns, where we  do,  in  fact,  discuss the issues of the day. There  is  even  more  trust  here  than  in  the  rest  of  the  nation  in  both  the  political  process  and  in  those  who carry it out. But even here, where we can be proud of our government involvement, we can do better. I am committed to achieving a new level of openness, accessibility, and responsiveness in state government. It will occur on all levels. The  highway  engineer  who  designs  a  local  road,  the  health  department  inspector  who  tests  water  quality, and  the  tax department official who asks you for  just a  little bit more — each one of  them will make a renewed effort to serve the public to the very best of his and her ability. And we, in turn, must recognize and respect the difficulty of their tasks. They are state employees. They are trained to give their best, and often their best goes unnoticed. I  intend  to  build  good  morale,  reward  excellence,  and  put  a  recognizable  face  on  what  has  been  called  a “faceless bureaucracy”. State employees will recognize you, the Vermont citizen, for who you are — their most important customer. And you in turn will be asked to recognize them as hard working and successful public servants. There will also be a new openness within state government. We  must  establish  new  and  more  open  lines  of  communication  between  the  executive  branch  and  state employees, as well as among agencies and departments. Problems  know  no  neat  and  tidy  boundaries,  despite  the  best  efforts  of  public  officials  to  put  them  in  little square boxes. When we address  job  training, a clean environment, and unemployment, we have  to adopt a plan of action that disregards the usual categories and shapes new entities to meet our needs. Our  human  service  programs  depend  on  the  success  of  our  economic  development  programs,  and  they  in turn, depend on the quality of our education. The best way to get off welfare is to get a job, and the best way to get a job, is through education. Neither can we delude ourselves  into believing  that  there  is a choice between economic growth and a clean and healthy environment. The two are inseparable. The  five  agency  secretaries  who  were  recently  appointed  fully  recognize  their  interdependence  and  will work collegially to achieve our mutually-shared goals. They  bring  much  energy,  a  new  vision  and  special  skills  to  their  tasks.  You  will  be  proud  of  their achievements. But  as  they  begin  their  work,  they  know,  as  we  all  do,  that  in  this  year  of  the  deficit  we  must  be  prudent managers. The  deficit  will  be  retired  as  planned.  I  am  committed  to  adhering  to  the  schedule  which  this  body  has established. In Vermont, we have  always known, here  in  this  state of hard  scrabble hill  side  farms,  that we  live  a world of limits. Living on the margin, we learned to husband our natural resources. The  stones  in  the  field were  not merely moved  into  a  pile —  they were  carefully  placed,  one  on  top  of  the other, forming perfect walls of protection. As  we  learned  to  become  stewards  of  our  natural  resources,  so  must  we  now  learn  to  be  stewards  of  our financial resources.  It will be neither a simple nor a painless process. We will face difficult choices. We will have to recycle limited tax dollars, just as we have recycled limited natural resources. Our  challenge  in  the  next  two  years  is  clear  --  we  must  learn  to  live  in  a  world  of  financial  limits,  while moving forward on the problems of our time. But, we must distinguish between financial restraint and political paralysis. We  cannot  afford  to  stand  still,  because  that  too,  has  a  cost.  In  fact;  if  we  do  not  invest  now,  despite  the sacrifice  it will  demand,  in  a  sound  education  and  a  clean  environment, we will  pay  a  greater  price  years  from now. Within  the  restrictions  of  financial  limits,  there  are exciting possibilities. Under  these pressures,  innovation and fresh thinking are in high demand. Our challenge in 1985 is to balance responsibility and hope. We must also think beyond this year, and plan our long term future.  In my dictionary, the future is defined through our children.  It is their education and well-being that we must assure. In that sense, all Vermonters are parents for the next generation. Raising the drinking age to 21 is one step we can and must take to make certain our young people are spared from being victims or perpetrators of drunk driving accidents. I appeal to this body to make that a first priority in this legislative session. Secondly,  I  ask  you  to work  toward  a  goal  that  I  sense we  already  share —  quality  education  and  property tax relief. Increased  state  aid,  access  to  kindergarten,  coordinated  job  training  for  adults  —  these  are  education priorities for this session. In my  budget  address,  I will  spell  out  the  details  of  these  proposals,  as well  as  programs  geared  directly  to property  tax  relief:  a  property  tax  deferral  program  for  senior  citizens  and  a  revenue-sharing  program  for  local government. Access  to  higher  education,  both  public  and  private,  is  another  investment  we  cannot  postpone.  We  must look  for  innovative  partnerships  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  and  higher  education,  to  enhance  the economy of Vermont and bring it into the vanguard. To  further  bolster  our  Vermont  economy,  and  to  shield  us  from  later  economic  downturns,  I  ask  you  to make a renewed effort  to provide more  jobs  to  those areas of  the state where  it has been most difficult  to create new jobs. We cannot accept the status quo. We can and we will do better. I will propose two pieces of legislation which will move us in that direction. — A Vermont Venture Capital Corporation and Job Zones. Both  initiatives will create economic growth by using  the  resources of  the public  sector  to stimulate private investment. In keeping with  the accessible  spirit of  this administration,  I will direct  the Secretaries of Development and Community Affairs and of Environmental Conservation to streamline rules and regulations affecting business. We will continue to be regulators, but let us assure ourselves that the regulations are necessary and serve the purpose of promoting the public good, rather than promoting a burgeoning bureaucracy. Our  commitment  to  our  children’s  future  begins  with  our  support  for  parents.  The  focus  of  the  Agency  of Human Services in my administration will be to strengthen the Vermont family in several ways: 1.    We  will  establish  clear  goals  to  measure  our  success,  such  as  increased  incidence  of  healthy  birth weights,  increased  number  of  parents  who  complete  high  school,  and  decreased  cases  of  verifiable  child  and spouse abuse. 2.    We  will  establish  a  working  group  to  define  how  to  better  coordinate  and  organize  the  Department  of Social  Welfare  and  the  Department  of  Social  and  Rehabilitation  Services,  with  one  goal  in  mind,  to  provide better services to Vermont families. Under  the  leadership  of  the  new  Secretary,  the  Agency  will  also  keep  a  watchful  eye  on  services  for  the elderly,  and  those who  are most  vulnerable  in  our  society. We must  be  certain  that  they  are  not  ignored  as  the federal government proposes drastic cutbacks. But the Agency alone cannot meet all needs. Greater  cooperation  with  private  social  service  agencies  and  with  the  private  sector  will  characterize  this administration. In  this  spirit,  I  will  call  a  child  care  conference  for  Vermont  employers  to  assist  and  encourage  them  in providing child care options for their employees. The private employer has not only much to give in the area of child care, but also has much to gain — better morale, increased productivity and lower turnover. In former years, a Governor could turn towards environmental issues and separate them from human service issues.  One  seemed  to  concentrate  on  “objects”  and  the  other,  on  “people”.  The  environment  was  largely  an aesthetic issue —“Keep Vermont Beautiful.” That  is  no  longer  true.  The  environmental  issues  of  our  time  are  health  issues  and  very  directly  affect  the lives of people. This creates a new sense of urgency  to act  in a  responsible and expedient manner  to protect  the public. It is the point where nature meets technology which has turned into an unknown quantity. We know we have taken uncalculated risks, which we have yet to define and contain. To  help  us  cope  with  consequences  of  our  actions,  as  well  as  to  prevent  future  environmental  problems,  I will  propose  that  we  create  a  mini-superfund  to  clean  up  hazardous  areas  and  to  set  standards  for  those  who produce, transport and store these materials. I will  strongly  support  right-to-know  about  hazardous materials  in  the workplace,  either  through  regulation or legislation. In  keeping  with  our  collegial  spirit,  a  sub-cabinet,  dealing  with  environmental  issues,  will  be  formed,  and will  include  the  Health  Department,  sections  of  the  Environmental  Agency,  and  the  Department  of  Labor  and Industry. A policy of reasonable growth will characterize my administration. Our task will be to protect and share our natural  resources  without  mandating  arbitrary  restrictions  on  growth.  Such  a  policy  often  can  be  achieved through  negotiation  and  technical  support.  Legislation  and  regulation  may  be  necessary  to  augment  that  — options which I will fully explore. As we know the limits of nature, we also know of its abundance. Our Vermont farms must continue not only to survive, but to thrive. As  Governor  of  the  State  of  Vermont,  I  assure  you,  I  will  not  stand  idly  by  if Washington  believes  it  can starve out the family farm. I will fight for our survival because the farm is the center of our rural way of life, it is the foundation of our tourist industry, and it gives us our basic character. It  is our agricultural heritage which guides Vermont  today, even as many Vermonters no  longer  themselves till the land. Ira Allen wrote in 1798: They are all farmers and again every farmer is a mechanic in some line or other, as inclination  leads or necessity  requires. The hand  that guides  the plow  frequently constructs  it, and  the  labors of the axe and the plane often evince a degree of genius and dexterity that would really amaze you.” This sense of ingenuity is our source of strength. It enabled us to survive as we carved these farms out of the hillside. It will enable us to survive today, and to set an example to the nation. Our environmental conscience in the early 70’s helped stir the conscience of the nation. Our nuclear freeze resolutions in the early 80’s at town meetings set a national movement in motion. Today, we have such an opportunity again. Our  ability  to  deal  fairly  with  the  harsh  realities  of  living  within  a  world  of  financial  limits  can  set  an example to the nation which is struggling to achieve that goal. Our task is to be both prudent and humane. I ask this General Assembly to join me in a bipartisan effort to achieve our shared goal. I  grew  up  in  this Chamber.  I  know  it well.  I  respect  it. There  is  a  special  feeling  of warmth  and  familiarity when I look across the span of this room. I ask you to share in the task ahead, as we jointly work to achieve more with less. I look forward to the challenge of leadership which Vermont has placed before me. I have faith, not only in my ability and in yours, but in our mutual resourcefulness. In Vermont, we have grown up with  the knowledge  that nature  indeed may be harsh and unpredictable, but also  with  the  assurance  that  each  season  brings  its  own  renewal  and  each  year  follows  a  certain  rhythm.  We know  it  is  not  only  possible  to  blend  austerity  and  optimism,  but  it  is  part  of  the  human  condition,  and  it  is essential to our survival. It was Governor George Aiken, whom we particularly miss on this day, who wrote in 1938: “Day  after  day  I  have  occasion  to  thank  God  that  I  am  Governor  of  Vermont.  Of  all  the  Governors  of  the United  States,  I  think  I  have  the  best  opportunity  to  observe  the  general  good  which  may  be  effected  by cooperation among groups. I don’t mean that we don’t have differences of opinion in Vermont . . . I want to say here and now that although our folks differ in the means, they all aim at the same ultimate end — and that is the welfare of our state.” I, like Governor Aiken, thank God that I am Governor of Vermont. It is an awesome task. It presents wonderful possibilities. With your help, and the blessings of the Almightly, we will succeed. Let us begin.
