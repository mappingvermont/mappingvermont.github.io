Executive  Speech of  Thomas Chittenden  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume III.   1790     October 20, 1790. The speech of his excellency governor CHITTENDEN, to the council and assembly GENTLEMEN OF THE COUNCIL AND ASSEMBLY: I have  received official  information of my appointment by  the  freemen of  this  state  to be  their governor  for the year ensuing.  My heart is imprest with a grateful sense of the singular respect shown and honor done me by this election. This day witnesses  the excellence and beauty of our glorious constitution; which by  the blessing of heaven, the  fortitude  and  perseverance  of  former  conventions,  councils,  and  assemblies,  with  the  aid  of  the  military force,  we  have  obtained  and  supported,  against  the  opposition  of  a  potent  foreign  power,  a  haughty neighbouring government, and numerous domestic opposers.   The constitution, gentlemen, grouped  [groped]  in the dark for days, months and years, but now it shines with purer lustre.  By it our lives, properties, liberties and privileges,  civil  and  religious,  are  protected:    By  it  we  retain  a  right  to  choose  our  own  rulers  and  that  from among  ourselves;  –  by  it  we  are  rescued  from  submitting  to  the  edicts  of  any  foreign  power,  or  neighboring government,  while  every  civil  officer  is  annually  taught  his  dependence.    The  appearance  of  this  day  also evinces,  that  our  government  is  well  established,  the  minds  of  the  people  happily  cemented,  and  every  thing contributes to complete our political felicity, and prepare the way for the happy day when we shall add no small weight  to  the scale, and be under  the protection of a new and glorious empire, which bids fair  in a short  time  to vie  in  power  and  policy with  any  of  the European States, which  gives me more  satisfaction  than  all  the  honors in the power of this or any other state to confer on me. It  is  with  some  reluctance  that  I  shall  enter  again  into  public  service,  all  circumstances  considered;  yet  the good  of  this  people  lies  so  near  my  heart,  that  when  duty  calls,  nothing  shall  deter  me  from  acting  that  part  I judge will contribute most  to  the peace, happiness and prosperity of  the people.   Therefore with a  firm  reliance on  receiving  that  kind  aid  and  support  from  the  Council  and  House  of  Representatives  that  the  nature  of  my office  requires,  I  shall  accept  the  office  to which  I  am  elected,  and  am  ready  to  take  the  qualifications  pointed out  by  the  constitution;  and  I  pray God  to  grant me wisdom  to  conduct  agreeable  to his will,  and  then  I  trust  it will be for the best good of his and my people. The  Gazette  added:  “His  excellency  was  then  duly  qualified  by  chief  justice  Chipman  in  the  presence  of both houses, and a numerous body of spectators.”
