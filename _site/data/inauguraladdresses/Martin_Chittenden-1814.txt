Executive  Speech of  Martin Chittenden  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume VI.  1814    SPEECH OF GOV. MARTIN CHITTENDEN – 18141.  Gentlemen of the Council, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, – The unsolicited approbation of my conduct the year past, considering the extreme embarrassments under which I entered upon the duties of my office,  is  highly  gratifying,  and  will  not  fail  to  produce  renewed  exertion  to  promote  the  best  interests  of  my fellow  citizens.    At  the  same  time  it  affords  the  pleasing  hope  that  my  future  services  in  the  discharge  of  the duties of  the office, which  I have again undertaken, will be considered with  the  same  indulgence.   Without  it,  I should despair of discharging those duties in a satisfactory manner at this most difficult and eventful period. The true patriot can submit to no sacrifice of truth or principle, to procure his own advancement, or promote the  interests or views of a party.   Men may change, and parties may change – but  truth, principle and virtue are immutable.  It ought, therefore, to be our firm determination to pursue the plain path of duty with steadiness and fidelity.  In  declaring  my  undeviating  attachment  to  the  principles  of  our  wise  and  excellent  system  of  government, independently  of  any  regard, or blind devotion,  to  those who may have  administered  it,  I  am  sensible  that  high sounding professions are not  the  surest  test of sincerity, and shall,  therefore, only  refer you  to  the general  tenor of my conduct for future expectations. Our  foreign  relations  and  defensive  operations  being  exclusively  committed  to  the  management  of  the general  government,  excepting  in  particular  cases,  in  which  assistance  may  be  required,  our  attention  is principally confined  to  the  local concerns of  the State.   And  it affords me great pleasure  to have  it  in my power to  observe,  that  the  internal  quiet  security  and  prosperity  of  our  fellow  citizens,  for  the  year  past,  has  been unexampled for times like the present. Justice  has  been  promptly,  and,  I  believe,  impartially  administered,  the  laws  duly  respected,  and  litigation gradually  diminishing  –  the  natural  and  certain  consequence  of  a  well  placed  confidence  in  any  upright  and intelligent  judiciary.   Our  fiscal concerns have been conducted with  that  fidelity and correctness which were  to be expected from the acknowledged talents and integrity of the officer at the head of that department. Our  schools  and  seminaries of  learning have not  suffered  that diminution  and depression which might have been  expected,  excepting  that  it  has  been  deemed  advisable  that  the  operations  of  one  nearest  the  seat  of  war2 should suffer a temporary suspension, that, at a future and more favorable period, they might be resumed, under better prospects and with increased vigor and energy. The  economy  and  correctness  with  which  that  liberal  and  humane  institution,  established  for  the  security and  correction  of  state  criminals,  has  been  conducted,  affords  the  consoling  prospect  of  its  great  usefulness  to the community, evinces a general improvement in the state of society, and probably will afford some revenue to the State. Notwithstanding the corrupting and demoralizing tendency of a state of war, our citizens have enjoyed their civil and religious privileges in an unusual degree. The distinguished  talents,  integrity, and experience, of which your honorable body  is composed, will render my duties less arduous, and afford a sure pledge to our constituents that their best interests will be promoted. Man  never  appears  in  a  more  responsible  and  truly  dignified  station  than  when  called  to  act  as  a representative  of  a  free,  sovereign,  and  independent  people.   We  are  selected  from  among  our  fellow  citizens, not for the base and degrading purpose of securing our own promotion aggrandizing our particular friends, or to favor the views and interests of a party – but to consider the whole community as one common family, and like faithful guardians of their rights endeavor to promote the general welfare. Yours  is  the  duty,  and  on  you,  gentlemen,  rests  the  responsibility,  of  selecting  proper  persons  to  fill  the various  offices  in  this  State  for  the  ensuing  year  –  persons  to  whom  we may  safely  trust  the  administration  of justice  in  all  its  important  branches,  and  on whom we must,  in  a  great measure,  depend  for  the  preservation  of                                                  1 From printed Assembly Journal of 1814, p. 15.  2 The University of Vermont. the  peace  and  internal  quiet  of  the  state.    It  will  likewise  become  your  duty  to  select  a  suitable  person  to represent this State in the Senate of the United States from and after the third day of March next. In the execution of these important duties, the most perfect confidence is entertained, that you will, unbiased by local or party considerations, be influenced by a single view to the public good. The great importance of a well organized militia in a free state cannot escape the notice of a wise legislature.  The  want  of  precision  and  energy  into  our  present  military  system  must  be  apparent  to  every  man  who  is conversant  in  military  affairs,  and  demands  a  revision  to  adapt  it  to  the  exigencies  arising  from  our  exposed situation.    It  would  be  desirable  that  the  burthen  should  be  equalized,  as  far  as  is  practicable,  that  the  weight may not rest on those who are least able to bear it. We  have  a  right  to  demand  from  the  general  government  full  protection  and  security.    Still  it  is  but  too evident  from  past  experience,  that much  depends  upon  our  own  exertions.   May  not  this  consideration  suggest the  expediency  of  adopting  some  further  measures  for  arming  the  militia,  and  providing  field  artillery  and munitions of war, which may be applicable to sudden emergencies?  We have before us the example of many of our  sister  states  for  raising a  small volunteer corps, which may be  relied on,  in case of  sudden alarm, and  serve as a rallying point for other and efficient aid. As  we  are  authorized  by  the  constitution  to  look  to  the  general  government  for  that  protection  which  our exposed  situation may  require,  it must  be  perfectly  evident,  that  the militia were  only  designed  to  be  called  in aid  of  the  regular  force  in  particular  cases.    Those  instances,  which  have  occurred  during  the  last  year,  have been met  by  our  patriotic  and  brave  citizens with  a  promptitude,  spirit  and  zeal which  are  highly  honorable  to themselves, and which render them worthy of the gratitude of their country. To meet the request of Gen. MACOMB, for assistance, on the late incursion of the enemy, which terminated so  gloriously  for  the  American  arms,  there  being  no  portion  of  the  militia  detached  or  called  for  by  the President, in conformity to the laws of the United States, it was considered that a call upon our patriotic citizens for their voluntary services was the only mode, by which efficient and timely aid could possibly be afforded. The  result  has  been  such,  as  many  of  you,  gentlemen,  have  witnessed.    It  far  exceeded,  in  extent,  our reasonable expectations.  By it the enemy have been taught a useful, although mortifying lesson, that the soil of Freemen will not bear the tread of hostile feet with impunity. At  the same  time  it  reflects  the highest honor on  the patriotism, spirit and valor of our  fellow citizens, who, without  distinction  of  age,  character,  or  party,  were  ready  to  brave  danger,  in  its  most  formidable  appearance, for  the  defence  of  their  country.    And  it  should  seem  that  it  ought  to  palsy  the  tongue  of  slander  –  every desirable  object  having  been  secured,  and  in  a manner  the  least  burthensome  and  offensive  to  the  feelings  of  a free and enlightened people. Much  is  due  to  Gen.  STRONG,  and  our  brave  volunteers;  and  I  am  requested  by  the  Secretary  of  War  to present  them  the  thanks  of  the  general  government  “for  their  prompt  succor  and  gallant  conduct  in  the  late critical state of this frontier.” I  should  do  injustice  to  my  own  feelings,  as  well  as  violence  to  every  correct  principle,  were  I  to  refrain from testifying the high sense which I entertain of the brilliant achievement of Commodore MACDONOUGH, and his  intrepid  associates, on Lake Champlain,  over  a  far  superior  naval  force –  an  achievement which  renders  all encomium feeble and inadequate. I should  likewise do  injustice,  if I should neglect  to notice  the cool, persevering, and brave conduct of Brig. Gen. MACOMB, and his alike brave associates  in arms,  in  the discomfiture of a greatly superior force of veteran troops, commanded by experienced officers. These  glorious  achievements  are  not  surpassed  in  the  records  of  naval  and military warfare.   New  lustre  is added to the national character.  But the effects are more immediately experience by the northern sections of the State of Vermont and New York. This  late  special  interference  of  the  Almighty  in  our  behalf,  in  completely  defeating  the  hostile  designs  of the  enemy  on  our  northern  borders,  cannot  fail  to  render  it  a  subject  of  respectful  legislative  notice.    And although  it  may  not  be  in  our  power  to  add  to  the  laurels  of  those  gallant  commanders,  and  their  brave associates,  who,  under  Providence,  were  the  authors  of  our  protection  and  safety,  yet  we  may  express  our gratitude to heaven, and to them, for so great a deliverance. I  have  received  a  letter  from  the  governor  of  the  State  of  Pennsylvania, which  enclosed  a  resolution  of  the Senate  and  House  of  Representatives  of  that  State,  proposing  an  amendment  of  the  constitution  of  the  United States,  –  by which  the  term  of  service  of  Senators  in Congress  shall  be  reduced  from  six  to  four  years.    I  have received,  likewise,  a  letter  from  the  governor  of  the  State  of  Tennessee,  enclosing  a  resolution  of  the  general assembly of that State proposing an amendment of the same import.  These papers will be laid before you.  And should any  thing further of  importance come  to my knowledge during  the present session, of which you are not possessed, it will be made the subject of a special communication. On  the  subject  of  the  war,  in  which  our  country  is  most  unfortunately  engaged,  I  feel  disposed,  at  this critical  period,  to  say  as  little  as  may  be  consistent  with  duty.    But  I  consider  it  due  to  myself,  and  more especially  to my constituents, explicitly  to  state,  that  the events of  the war have  in no wise altered my opinions of its origin, or its progress.  I have conscientiously and uniformly disapproved of it, as unnecessary, unwise and hopeless,  in all  its offensive operations. – And notwithstanding  the  few brilliant  successes we have met with  in our operations of defence, I can see very little in its general complexion, which affords the least consolation. Many very considerable places on our seaboard are now  in  the possession of  the enemy.   The capital of our country,  that  proud  monument  of  better  times,  has  been  possessed  and  destroyed  by  him  –  a  humiliating reflection  to  every  real  American.    And  I  consider,  that  we  are  now  suffering  the  evils  which  have,  from  the mistakes and misconduct of rulers, befallen this, as well as most of the nations of the earth. It therefore becomes us to look calmly and firmly on our dangers, and meet them like men, who are mindful of what they owe to their own characters, and what they owe to their country. It would have afforded me heartfelt satisfaction  to have been able  to announce  to you  the  return of peace  to an afflicted people.  But our reasonable hopes, on this subject, not having been realized, and the particular spirit, with which the war appears to be prosecuted by the enemy, renders defensive measures and operations not only necessary, but  righteous and  just,  in which we may engage with  feelings most honorable and praiseworthy, and with a firm reliance on the Almighty, who has never forsaken us in the hour of peril. I shall now, gentlemen, cheerfully proceed in the discharge of the duties of this office assigned me, – and in the  prosecution  of  the  business  of  the  present  session,  you may  be  assured  of my  cordial  co-operation  in  every measure, which has for its object the promotion of the public good. MARTIN CHITTENDEN.
