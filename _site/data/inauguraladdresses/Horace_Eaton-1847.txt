Inaugural address  of  Horace Eaton  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  October Session   1847  Saturday, October 16, 1847 Inaugural Address  Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: The  annual  assembling  of  our  State Legislature  ever  presents  an  appropriate  season  for  a  passing  survey  of those prominent incidents pertaining to our common welfare, which have marked the previous year.  And, upon such  a  survey on  the  present  occasion, we  find ourselves  surrounded with  abundant  causes  for gratitude  to  that Benificent  Being  from  whom  we  receive  every  good.    The  year  has  been  characterized  by  a  cheering  state  of activity  and  prosperity  in  our  business  operations;  and  although  our  rejoicing  in  this  respect  should  perhaps  be somewhat  tempered  by  the  reflection  which  forces  itself  upon  us  that  this  favorable  condition  is  to  no  small extent a  result of  the destitution and distress which have prevailed  in other  lands, yet  such a  remembrance may serve to impress upon us the more deeply a sense of obligation that we, too, have not been suffering the want of bread.    So  far  from  this,  we  have  been  enjoying  an  unstinted  supply  of  the  fruits  of  the  earth  during  the  year past, and another rich harvest has been freshly gathered in.  Our people, too, have been preserved from any wide spread  and  desolating  sickness;  civil  order  has  been  maintained;  and  our  distinguishing  social  and  religious privileges, unimpaired, have been yielding, for our enjoyment, their rich and countless blessings. As we enter upon the discharge of our legislative duties, let us not only bear in mind our obligations to those who have committed  their  interests  to our care, but also recognize our responsibility  to a Higher Power.   Under the generally received and substantially correct doctrine, that laws are but the expression of the public mind and an  index  of  public  morals,  there  is  danger  of  our  overlooking  a  truth  of  great  practical  importance  that  lies beyond.  Laws themselves, in turn, exert an influence in forming the character of a people.  The estimate which those, who are assumed to be among the wisest and most virtuous of the State, impliedly place upon certain acts by  their  legislation,  goes  far  to  mould  the  public  sentiment  in  regard  to  those  acts.    And,  in  view  of  the educational  influence  which  the  legislator  in  this  way  exerts,  he  should  not  regard  it  as  his  paramount  and exclusive  purpose  to  register  the  public will,  but  he  should  also  aim  to  be  guided  in  every  act  of  legislation  by the elevated principles of a sound Christian morality.   In attempting to comply with that provision of the constitution, which requires the Executive annually to lay before the legislature such business as he may think necessary, I do not deem it requisite for me to present every subject, even of public interest, which may properly claim your attention.  I regard it as sufficient for me simply to advert to such matters of public concern as would more appropriately claim the notice of the Executive, from the  fact,  that  information  pertaining  to  them  might  be  presumed  to  fall  more  especially  into  his  possession.  Members  of  the  legislature,  coming  as  they  do  from  different  quarters  of  the  State,  and  acquainted  as  they  are with  the  operation  of  existing  laws  upon  the  well  being  and  prosperity  of  the  several  sections  which  they respectively  represent,  will,  in  regard  to  most  matters  relating  to  the  public  welfare,  arrive  for  themselves  at more just and correct conclusions than any to which the Executive could guide them. Among  those  subjects  to  which  I  regard  it  as  proper  for  me  to  call  your  attention,  I  would  suggest  an apparent defect existing in the statute relating to public accounts.  There is no provision by which the Auditor is required  to give bonds for  the faithful discharge of his official duties.   In an office which holds so great control over  the  treasury,  without  any  effective  and  immediate  check  beyond  the  integrity  of  the  officer,  I  cannot  but regard the defect as one that ought to be remedied; and it is believed that no one holding the office would regard the requirement,  that he should give bonds, as oppressive or unreasonable.   The present Auditor of Accounts,  it is proper for me to state, concurs in these views. I  would  respectfully  suggest  to  the  Legislature  the  propriety  of  altering  our  laws  respecting  the  rights  of married  women,  so  as  to  secure  to  them  the  sole  control  and  benefit  of  all  property  which  they  may  have  at coverture,  or  receive  during  it,  in  their  own  right.    The  effect  of  such  a  provision  would  be  to  guard  married women  more  effectually  from  the  danger,  which  ever  increases  with  the  growth  of  a  state  and  the  consequent increase  of  business  and  its  hazards,  of  being  reduced  to  destitution  and  suffering  by  acts  in  which  they  have had  no  part,  and  in  whose  disastrous  consequences,  so  far  as  it  can  be  avoided,  they  should  not  share.    Other States  have  turned  their  attention  to  this  subject,  and  it  would  seem  that  our  State  should  not  be  less  ready  to give salutary and equitable protection to the wife – at least when it can be done without wrong to the husband or his creditors. I  deem  it my  duty  to  call  your  attention  to  an  act  passed  at  the  last  session  of  the  Legislature,  entitled  “An act  to  prevent  inposition  and  accidents  in  the  sale  of  medicines.”    The  provision  contained  in  the  act,  that  it should  not  go  into  effect  until  the  first  day  of  November,  1847,  would  seem  to  imply  that  doubts  were entertained as to the utility or expediency of the law by the legislature that passed it; as the provision appears to have  been  inserted  for  the  purpose  of  affording  an  opportunity  for  a  repeal  of  the  act  previous  to  its  taking effect.    Such  doubts were  certainly  entertained  by myself,  and  time  but  served  to  confirm  them.    It  is  strongly believed  that  an  attempt  to  carry  out  the  provisions  of  the  law  would  not  only  be  attended  with  great embarrassment  and  inconvenience,  but  would  altogether  fail  of  effecting  the  purposes  sought  to  be accomplished.    I  would,  therefore,  respectfully  recommend  a  repeal  of  the  act  in  question  –  and  should  the legislature  concur  with  me  in  the  main  opinion,  there  are  obviously  reasons  why  the  subject  should  receive immediate attention. It  is a source of much gratification  to me  to be able  to express my firm and decided convictions,  that, under the regulations recently adopted for the supervision of our common schools, and the efforts made in connection with  that supervision  to  improve  these  institutions and extend  their  influence, a palpable advancement has been made in many particulars, although much remains to be desired.  But as the condition of this great interest of the State,  and  its  present  demands  upon  us, will  be  considered  in  the Report  of  the  State  Superintendent, which  in due time will be laid before you, it is unnecessary for me to dwell upon this subject here. I  have  received  the  third  Annual  Report  of  the  State  Geologist,  and  it  is  now  in  process  of  publication.    It appears  from  the  Report,  that  the  survey  has  been  progressing  during  the  past  year  with  a  good  degree  of activity  and  success,  and  that  the  field  labor  has  been  mainly  completed,  only  a  small  portion  of  the  State remaining unexplored.  The sum originally appropriated for the purposes of the survey will be exhausted on the first  day  of  March  next;  and  from  the  estimates  of  the  Geologist,  appended  to  the  Report,  it  appears,  that  an additional  appropriation  of  sixteen  hundred  dollars  a  year  for  two  years  will  be  required  to  complete  the remaining  systematic  field  labor;  to make  such  re-examinations of  certain  localities  as may be  found necessary in making out the final Report; and to prepare the Report for publication. I have heretofore so strongly expressed my convictions of  the utility and  importance of  this great work, and of  its  credit  to  the State,  that  it  is needless  for me  to  say  that  I  trust  the  appropriations will be  readily made,  so that no obstacle shall be presented to its successful and honorable completion. In  accordance  with  a  resolution  passed  at  the  last  session  of  the  legislature,  directing  me  to  appoint  some one  to  examine  the  documents  collected  by  Henry  Stevens,  Esq.,  relative  to  the  claims  of  this  State  upon  the government  of  the  United  States,  for  expenses  incurred  during  the  revolutionary  war,  I  appointed  the  Hon. Charles  K.  Williams,  whose  report  I  have  reason  to  believe  will  be  submitted  to  the  legislature  at  its  present session. To  carry  into  effect  the  resolution  of  the  last  session,  directing  me  to  appoint  some  suitable  person  or persons  to  correspond  with  the  sculptor  Powers,  respecting  proposed  statues  in  marble  of  Ethan  Allen  and Thomas Chittenden for the vacant niches in the lobby of the Capitol, I appointed the Hon. Charles Paine and the Hon. George P. Marsh.   Their report has not yet been received, nor am I apprised what progress has been made in the work assigned to them; but believe it will be faithfully accomplished at the earliest period practicable. Under  the  resolution  requesting me  to  examine  or  cause  to  be  examined  the Historical Collection  of Henry Stevens, Esq.,  I appointed  the Hon. Samuel C. Crafts, and A.G. Chadwick, Esq.,  to examine  the collection, and report  to me  the  number,  character,  and  value  of  the  books  and  documents which  it  embraced,  and  the  price  at which they could be obtained.  Their report has been made to me; but not feeling myself authorized to make the purchase  on  the  terms  proposed,  the  subject  is  open  for  such  action  as  the  legislature  may  see  fit  to  take  in regard to it.  The report of the Committee will be laid before you. Under  the  series  of  resolutions,  providing  for  the  collection  of  the  Surveyor  General’s  papers,  and  other documents  pertaining  to  the  history  of  the  State,  some  progress  has  been  made  towards  accomplishing  the purposes contemplated by the Legislature, but the business is not yet fully completed. During the year, communications on sundry topics have been received from several of the States, which will at  an  early  day  be  laid  before  you;  as  also  will  a  communication  from  one  of  the  Directors  of  the  New  York Institute  for  the Blind,  suggesting  the  propriety  of  a  provision  being made  by  this  State,  by which  a  part  of  its unfortunate  blind,  who  are  educated  at  the  expense  of  the  State,  may  be  placed  in  that  institution.    I  deem  it proper also  to  state  that  the  resolutions passed at  the  last  session of  the Legislature,  relating  to Slavery, and  the Mexican  War,  transmitted  by  me  to  the  executive  of  Virginia,  were  reconveyed  to  me  in  accordance  with  an order of the Legislature of that State, directing the Executive to “return them forthwith.”  This is not announced to you because any action in regard to it is supposed to be necessary, but as Vermont can have no fears that her honor will be dimmed by the contrast in the respective positions of the two States, it is deemed due to her that a record of the transaction should be in her own safe keeping. I  believe  that  the  position  of  Vermont  is  distinctly  understood  in  regard  to  all  those  great  questions  of national policy, which are  from  time  to  time agitating our national councils, and  in which Vermont  in common with  the other States of  the Union has so deep an  interest.    It affords occasion  for  the most profound  regret  that the unhappy war with  a neighboring Republic has not yet been  terminated,  but,  on  the  contrary,  is making  still greater  and  greater  demands  upon  the  blood  and  treasure  of  the  nation.    It  is  believed  that  Vermont  has  seen nothing  in  the  progress  of  the  contests,  to  change  her  sentiment,  either  in  regard  to  the  insufficiency  of  the grounds  on which  the war was  commenced,  or  the  unworthiness  of  the  purposes  for which  it  has  been waged.  She  cannot  recognize  the  general  government  as  committed  to  any  career  of  conquest,  nor will  she  regard  any unaccomplished  schemes  of  territorial  aggrandizement  as  presenting  an  obstacle  to  the  speedy  adjustment  of existing  difficulties.   Peace  she  unequivocally  and  earnestly  desires,  and  asks  for  no  territory, whether  slave  or free, as a condition of its establishment and security. It  remains  for  me  to  pledge  you  my  cordial  co-operation  in  all  your  efforts  to  promote  the  public  welfare.  And  impressed with  a  grateful  sense  of  our  obligations  to  those who have generously  committed  their  interests to  our  care  –  guided  by  firm  convictions  of  truth  and  right,  and  aided  by  that  Divine  Favor  which  alone  can insure success to the best devised plans, we may hope that our labors for the session will advance the substantial prosperity and happiness of the people of the State.  } Executive Chamber, October 16, 1847.
