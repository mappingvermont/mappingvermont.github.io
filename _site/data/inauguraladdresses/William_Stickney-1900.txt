Inaugural address of  William W. Stickney  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1900  Thursday, October 4, 1900 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: In  obedience  to  the  constitutional  requirement  to  prepare  such  business  as  may  appear  necessary  to  lay before  the  General  Assembly,  your  attention  is  invited  to  some  of  the  subjects,  the  investigation  of  which  is deemed important at this time.  STATE FINANCE.  The  financial;  condition  of  the State on  the  30th  day  of  June,  1900,  as  appears  from  the Treasurer’s  report, was as follows:  RESOURCES. Cash on band and in banks ..............................................................................................  $ 117,161 20  4,412 79 Due from towns, State tax  ...............................................................................................

Auditor’s orders unpaid  .................................................................................................. 13,971 54 ------------------    208,658 06   The amount, therefore, remaining available for the current fiscal year from July 1, 1900, to June 30, 1901, is $332, 915.93.  This shows a very satisfactory condition of the treasury, and is an improvement over two years ago. By  examination  of  the  report  of  the  State  Treasurer,  and  omitting  what  is  not  essential,  it  appears  that  the receipts,  including  cash  on  hand  and  disbursements  for  the  biennial  term  ending  June  30,  1900,  have  been  as follows:  RECEIPTS. Cash on hand and in banks, June 30, 1898 ......................................................................  $ 137, 431 76 Tax, collateral inheritance ................................................................................................ 39,988 89 841,633 47   “  corporation .................................................................................................................   “  State ............................................................................................................................ 355,972 50   From all other sources ....................................................................................................  255, 675 59  ------------------- Total ....................................................................................... $ 1,630,702 21   DISBURSEMENTS.

Besides  this  item  there were  orders  outstanding  and  unpaid  on  that  date  to  the  amount  of  $13,971.54.  So  that  all  the  orders  drawn  for State expenses for the biennial term amount to the sum of $1,242,299.80. The Auditor  reports  that,  after  deducting  the moneys  covered  into  the  treasury  on  account  of  receipts  from the  several  institutions  and  balances  from  officials,  the  net  amount  of  State  expenses  for  which  orders  were drawn for the biennial term was              $ 1,095,684.82, of which the follows is a  SUMMARY.

While these figures may not be absolutely accurate, they are approximately correct.  Now,  this  matter  of  State  expenses  is  a  subject  peculiarly  within  your  province,  for  it  is  written  into  our Constitution that “no money shall be drawn out of the treasury unless first appropriated by act of legislation.” Therefore,  there  is  not  an  item  of  expenditure  in  the  foregoing  list  that  does  not  merit  your  careful examination  in  detail.  And  it  at  the  close  of  the  session  there  is,  under  the  law,  a  single  dollar  of  the  State’s money  expended  extravagantly  or  for  an  object  for  which  the  taxpayer  ought  not  to  contribute,  we  shall  be responsible and will remain responsible until our successors are elected. For you not only make every new appropriation, but also sanction and acquiesce in every existing law which authorizes the payment of money from the treasury. On the very threshold of the session, then, it is advisable to examine carefully the reports of the several State officers, which have been prepared at great  expense of  labor  and money,  so  as  to be  able  to  form  an  intelligent judgment upon what expenditures are necessary or reasonable. If you will do  this faithfully, you will not find  it necessary to take an adjournment for the purpose of going home the first week of the session. Every  member  of  the  General  Assembly  should  make  this  examination  for  himself  and  act  upon  his  own opinion. For it has been well said that the best legislation is attained by the combined judgment of average men. Within  the  time  reasonable  to  occupy,  I  can  call  your  attention  to  only  a  few  subjects  relating  to  State expenses, and leave the greater part of the field open for your investigation. It  appears  that  there  has  been  paid  during  the  last  ten  years,  in maintaining  the military  organization  of  the State, the sum of $251,726.04. This averages over $25,000.00 a year. It  is  without  question  the  part  of  wisdom  to  maintain  a  regiment  of  militia  and  keep  it  in  a  high  state  of efficiency  as  a nucleus  for military organization  in  case  of war. Thorough  preparation  for war  usually  prevents war.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  evident  that  our  military  establishment  is  too  expensive  and  its  cost  ought  to  be diminished. We  are  now  maintaining  a  brigade  organization  with  only  a  regiment  of  infantry  to  command.  I  would, therefore,  recommend  that  the  office  of  Brigade  Commander  be  abolished,  and  that  the  law  establishing  a brigade  organization  be  repealed.  I would  also  ask  you  to  inquire whether  the  office  of Adjutant  and  Inspector General  and  the  office  of  Quarter-master  General  could  not  be  consolidated  and  the  duties  of  both  offices performed by one person. Inasmuch  as  it  is  thought  that  Congress  may  soon  enact  some  measure  looking  to  greater  uniformity between the National Guard and the regular army, it would not seem wise, for the present, to make any increase in the number of the militia. COMMISSIONER OF STATE TAXES. In  recent  years  offices  and  commissions  have  been  created  for  temporary  purposes  and  when,  once established have become  fixtures. As example,  there  is  the office of Tax Commissioner. Probably  it  is now  the chief sinecure of the State. The  expense of  this office  for  the  last biennial  term was $3,087.99 of which $2,200.00 was paid  for  salary, $600.00  for  clerk  hire,  and  the  balance  for  stationery  and  incidentals.  Without  the  possibility  of  successful contradiction, it is asserted that the whole duties of the office could be performed by the Stale Treasurer without material addition to his labors. The army of aspirants who have already applied  to serve  the State  in  this position demonstrates  the wisdom of  the  fathers  in  providing  in  our  Constitution  that  “whenever  an  office  becomes  so  profitable  as  to  occasion many  to apply for  it,  the profit ought  to be  lessened.” And  they might well have added,  that whenever an office becomes unnecessary it ought to be abolished which I now recommend. I would  also  suggest  that  the  duties  of  the  office  be  assigned  to  the  State  Treasurer  and  that  he  receive  the same sum for clerk hire as the Tax Commissioner is now allowed I  think  it  worth  your  investigation  to  ascertain  whether  the  State  would  take,  any  detriment  if  the  State Prison,  House  of  Correction,  and  Industrial  School  were  all  placed  under  one  board  of  management.  These institutions, it is true, differ to some extent in character, but the duties of the directors or trustees are practically identical.  The  law  of  1878,  placing  the  State  Prison  and  House  of  Correction  under  one  board,  seems  to  have worked satisfactorily. It would appear that this principle might be extended to advantage. INTEREST ACCOUNT. The State ought not to pay higher interest than the market rate. Let us take one item as an illustration. There is  included  in  the  liabilities  of  the State  an  item of $14,383.26, on  account of United States deposit money due to towns. Of this sum $392.49 belongs to unorganized towns and gores and is property left in the State treasury. The  whole  amount  of  the  United  States  deposit  money  held  in  the  State  aggregates  $669,086.79.  As  you know,  this  is  divided  among  the  towns  according  to  population  and  is  redistributed  once  in  ten  years.  A  great majority  of  the  towns  have  complied  with  the  spirit  of  the  law,  have  elected  trustees  and  have  received  their proportion of this fund. The  law  provides  that  the  State  Treasurer  shall  retain  the  share  apportioned  to  the  towns  which  have  not elected trustees and the shares of unorganized towns and gores and shall pay the interest to the towns and gores to which it belongs. Eleven  towns have  failed  to elect  trustees and are paid  interest at  the  rate of six per cent, per annum on  this fund. I would suggest that the statute regulating this matter be amended, and that the State Treasurer be directed to pay to the towns interest at the rate of three per cent per annum. It  is  not  equitable  for  all  of  the  towns  to  pay  a  part  of  the  towns more  than  the market  rate  of  interest  on  a State loan. The  foregoing  observations  are  intended  to  be  suggestive  only  and  your  attention  is  directed  to  a consideration of the whole matter of State expenses. BIENNIAL REPORTS. I wish  to  call  your  attention  to  the  biennial  reports  of  the  State  officers,  boards  and  commissions.  The  fact that no  special allusion  is here made  to  several of  them does not depreciate  their  importance. Each one of  them should receive your careful study and candid consideration. On  account  of  these  extended  reports  it  will  be  unnecessary  to  direct  attention  to  all  of  the  various institutions and interests of which they treat. HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE. But I wish to speak briefly in reference to the insane poor supported by the State.  The  trustees  report  that  the  full  capacity  of  the  hospital  at  Waterbury  is  five  hundred  patients,  and  of  the retreat at Brattleboro three hundred fifty, a total of eight hundred fifty. The present number at Waterbury is five hundred  fifty-one,  and  at  Brattleboro  two  hundred  ninety-one,  making  the  total  number  of  patients  now  under State  care  eight hundred  forty-two. They predict  that, within one year, both hospitals will be overcrowded, and recommend  the  feasibility  of  erecting  cottages  for  the  feeble-minded  inmates  who  do  not  require  constant medical attendance. It  is  notorious  that  the  hospitals  are  being  filled  up  with  demented  paupers,  who  only  need  care  and  a comfortable place in which to live. They require neither restraint nor treatment for insanity. Now,  instead  of  erecting  new  buildings  at  large  expense, would  it  not  be  better  to  enforce  the  present  law, or,  if necessary, enact a new one so  that demented persons who require neither restraint nor  treatment would be supported by  the several  towns  in which  they belong? The present  law does not seem  to sufficiently protect  the interests of the State. This whole matter should receive your careful consideration. BOARD OF HEALTH Your attention  is particularly  invited  to  the  report of  the State Board of Health. From a careful examination of their work, it appears that they have done much to stamp out and prevent the spread of contagious diseases. The application of special knowledge in this direction has resulted in one of the greatest triumphs of modern science.  The  results  are  as  beneficent  in  the  security  to  human  life  as  they  are  economical  in  the  saving  of money. In  connection with  the  board  there  has  been  established  the  Laboratory  of Hygiene  at Burlington, which  is thoroughly  equipped  and  is  a  model  of  its  kind.  The  director,  Dr.  J.  H.  Linsley,  is  a  very  competent  and enthusiastic worker in this department of special knowledge. Where the public health is involved, the question of cost is secondary. The appropriations  for  this board  should be  sufficient not only  to meet  the necessary but probable demands that will be made upon it. LIBRARIES The  Library  Commission  has  done  efficient  work  for  a  very  small  outlay  of  the money  of  the  State.  It  has demonstrated  its  usefulness. You  ought  to  inquire  if  the  appropriation  for  its work  is  sufficient  for  reaping  the best results. There are  in  the State one hundred seven  town public  libraries, eighty-eight of which were brought into existence by the Hazen law of 1894, and the efforts of the Library Commission. There are over one hundred  thirty  towns  in  the State without any  library  facilities. Many of  these  towns are small, and cannot support a public library. Yet, for a very small expenditure, they could all be reached by means of the traveling library. For this work you will be requested to make a small appropriation, which I recommend. For a government organized like our own depends for its existence on the intelligence of the people, and this is greatly promoted by library facilities. TEMPERANCE. The promotion of temperance is among the most important objects which should engage the attention of the community at  large. The question  that comes within  the domain of  legislation  is between permitting, under due regulation,  the  traffic  in  intoxicating  liquors  for  the  indiscriminate  purpose  of  drinking,  and  the  prohibition  of the traffic for such general purpose. Believing  that,  in  our  State  as  a whole,  prohibition  is  the  best method  for  regulating  the  traffic,  I  think  the prohibitory  system  ought  to  be  continued.  I  concur  in  the  belief  of  one  of  my  predecessors  that  the  great  and manifold evils of in temperance are not to be essentially alleviated by any scheme for licensing the traffic. UNITED STATES SENATOR. It  becomes  your  duty  at  this  session  to  elect  a  Senator  to  represent  this  State  in  the Congress  of  the United States  for  the  unexpired  term  of  the  late  Senator  Justin  S. Morrill, which  ends  on  the  3d  day  of March, A. D., 1903, and heretofore filled by the temporary appointment of Hon. Jonathan Ross. REAPPORTIONMENT OF STATE SENATORS. The Constitution  provides  in  effect,  that  the  Senate  shall  be  composed  of  thirty members,  that  each  county shall  be  entitled  to  one  Senator  and  the  remainder  of  the  Senators  shall  be  apportioned  to  the  several  counties according to their population, as ascertained by the United States census. Since  1890  there  has  been  such  a  change  in  the  relative  population  of  some  of  the  counties  as  in  all probability to require a reapportionment of the Senators therein, Such legislation ought to be had at the present session as shall provide for the expected contingency. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. The period has arrived when amendments to the Constitution can be initiated. It  seems  to me  that  it would be well  to modify  the present provisions of  the Constitution  in  reference  to  the method of securing an amendment to the in itself. The Constitution now provides “that the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasable right to reform or alter  the government  in such manner as shall be, by  that community,  judged most conducive  to  the public weal.” But by the present method, articles of amendment can only be proposed “every tenth year.” So that however great the occasion, no change can be made in the interim. Under free government the people ought to be able to trust themselves. I  think  the Constitution would  be  properly  safeguarded  if  amendments were  allowed  to  be  proposed  at  any biennial session of the Legislature, leaving the other provisions concerning amendments as they are at present. For now, before any proposed amendment can become effective, the Senate must by vote of two-thirds of its members propose it, and it must be concurred in by a majority of the members of the House of Representatives. After  that,  it  is  referred  to  the  General  Assembly  next  to  be  chosen,  and,  if  a  majority  of  the  members  of  the Senate  and  the  House  of  Representatives  of  the  next  following  General  Assembly  shall  respectively  concur  in the  proposal,  it  becomes  the  duty  of  the General Assembly  to  submit  the  proposed  amendment  to  a  direct  vote of  the  freemen  of  the  State,  a majority  of whose  votes  is  required  before  the  proposed  amendment  be  comes  a part of the Constitution. At present,  therefore, no amendment can be adopted until  the  third year after  it  is proposed. For example,  if an  amendment were  proposed  at  this  session,  it would be  referred  to  the Legislature of 1902,  and,  if  concurred in, then to the people in March. 1903. By this method, sufficient time intervenes to allow a full discussion and proper consideration. Proposals  of  amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  may  be  made  at  any  regular  session  of Congress. Yet none has been made to that instrument within the last thirty years. Likewise,  in  most  of  the  States  of  the  Union,  amendments  can  be  initiated  at  any  regular  session  of  the Legislature. I would also recommend that the day for holding the State election be changed to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and the time for convening the General Assembly be altered to the first Wednesday in January. In  every  alternate  biennial  term  we  hold  two  elections,  one  for  State  officers  and  another  for  presidential electors.  The inconvenience and expense of the extra election might be avoided.  Nearly  all  the  States  in  the  Union  now  hold  their  State  elections  on  the  federal  election  day.    No  good reason can be urged why Vermont should not adopt the same method.  I ask the Senate to give these subjects such deliberation as their importance demands. ALTERATIONS OF PUBLIC LAWS. The growing evil of the frequent alteration of the public statutes demands attention. The  Legislature  ought  to  be  very  reluctant  to  change  the  law  when  once  established. While  it  is  not  to  be questioned  that our statutory  law might be  improved  in many respects, yet  it  is well  to remember  that change  is not always improvement. When  the  rule  of  civil  conduct  answers  the  requisites  of  equity  and  utility,  it  ought  to  remain  undisturbed. Often  times  it  is  not  so  important what  the  law  is,  as  that  it  should  be  fixed  and  certain  so  that  the  people may have knowledge of the law, which they are bound to know. Sixty-one  years  ago  the  laws  of  this  State  were  compiled  under  the  name  of  the  Revised  Statutes.  Of  that revision  Chancellor  Kent,  in  a  note  in  his  learned  Commentaries  On  American  Law,  which  were  republished after  that date, wrote  the  following: “I  take  the occasion  to observe  that  this new  revised code of Vermont does credit to the learning, judgment, and taste with which it is prepared, digested, a published.” It  is questionable whether any considerable number of  the changes  in  the public  laws upon matters covered by that statute have materially improved the body of the statute law of the State. In 1894 at great expense to the State our public laws were revised under the title of the Vermont Statutes.  Two sessions of the Legislature only have elapsed since this work was done, and yet more than two hundred and seventy sections of that Statute have been amended or repealed. The  good  legislator  is  the  one  who  votes  against  every  measure  which  cannot  be  demonstrated  to  be  a substantial improvement of the existing law. Permit me to suggest, that there ought to be more of the needed legislation accomplished in the early days of a session and less of it postponed to the end. It is within your power to remedy this injurious practice. CONCLUSION. In conclusion,  let me  say  that  the State  is without  the burden of a public debt. Peace, plenty, and prosperity reign  within  our  borders.  For  these  blessings  we  ought  to  return  thanks  to  the  Giver  of  every  good  and  every perfect gift. I cherish the hope that the welfare of all the people will be faithfully guarded and promoted by you. As  for  myself,  I  am  deeply  sensible  of  the  responsibility  which  attends  the  trust  reposed  in  me  by  the citizens of my native State. The measure of my ambition will be satisfied if the public interest does not suffer at my hands. Now, with a  firm  reliance upon Him without whose aid our  labors are vain,  let us devote our best efforts  to the business of the State.  WILLLAM W. STICKNEY Montpelier, October 4, 1900.
