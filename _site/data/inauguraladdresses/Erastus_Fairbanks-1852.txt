Inaugural address  of  Erastus Fairbanks  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives   October Session  1852  Saturday, October 16, 1852 Inaugural Address  Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: An  overruling  Providence  has  preserved  to  the  people  of  this  State  the  enjoyment  of  their  civil  rights  and their  cherished  institutions,  and  the  revolution  of  another  political  year  has  again  convoked  their  chosen representatives,  invested  with  the  functions  of  government,  and  charged  with  the  responsible  duties  of legislation. The  power  of  self-government,  inherent  in  the  people,  they  have  delegated  temporarily  to  us,  their  chosen servants,  to  be  exercised  by  us  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  constitution,  for  the  promotion  of  the general good, and the security of the rights of all. In performance of these functions, it will become our obvious duty  to  have  special  reference  as  well  to  the  moral  and  intellectual  improvement  of  the  community,  as  to  the security  and  advancement  of  their  secular  interests;  since  the  latter,  to  a  degree  which  cannot  be  too  highly appreciated, are intimately identified with and dependent upon the former.   The  blessings  of  Providence  have  been  liberally  bestowed  upon  the  people  of  this  commonwealth.    The almost universal prevalence of health – the abundant harvest which has crowned the labors of the husbandman – the  success which  has  attended  the  enterprise  of  those  engaged  in  other  pursuits  –  the  competency  extensively enjoyed  by  all  classes  of  the  people  –  the  equality  of  station  and  condition  –  the  comparatively  high  state  of morals  general  prevailing,  and  the  extended  means  of  religious  and  intellectual  instruction,  call  for  devout gratitude to the Great Disposer of events, who has bestowed these favors in such rich profusion. Nor are our national blessings less signal.  We are at peace with all the world – our domain extends from the Atlantic  to  the  Pacific  ocean,  and  in  latitude  embraces  every  desirable  climate,  rich  in  agricultural  and mineral resources and capabilities – our canvas whitens every ocean and sea – our  lakes and rivers, for many  thousands of  miles  are  traversed  by  steamers  freighted  with  the  products  of  the  soil  and  the  productions  of  our  artisans, while  in  every  direction  through  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  land,  is  seen  the  railroad  car,  facilitating  the intercourse between far distant states, and promoting the wealth and cementing the fraternity of the whole. Nor  should  it  be  forgotten  that  while  the  iron  yoke  of  despotism  is  fast  riveted  upon  the  necks  of  those nations  of  the  old  world,  upon  which  the  light  of  liberty  seemed  but  recently  to  dawn,  and  for  whom,  in  their noble  struggles  for  freedom,  our warmest  sympathies were  awakened  –  our  beloved  country  affords  an  asylum for the oppressed of every nation, and seems designed by Providence for the full development of the adaptation of  a  republican  government  and  free  religious  toleration,  to  meet  the  wants  and  protect  the  rights  of  man  in whatever class or condition of life. Your duties as legislators are less complex and varied than those imposed upon the legislative assemblies of most  of  our  sister  States,  from  the  fact  that  the  pursuits  of  our  citizens  are  mainly  agricultural.    We  have  no extensive foreign commerce, no maritime coasts, and but a limited capital employed in manufacturing. Our  system  of  jurisprudence,  perfected  by  the  wisdom  of  former  legislatures,  requires  no  material modification.    Indeed,  it  is  questionable whether  any  change  in  the  features  of  our  existing  statute  laws,  unless clearly  demanded  by  the  expressed  sentiments  of  the  people,  might  not  prove  injurious  in  its  practical  results, and  lay  the  foundation  for  increased  litigation.    A  review  of  the  past  history  of  legislation  in  the  State  will probably  develop  the  fact  that  in many  instances  alterations  and  amendments  of  existing  statues  have  had  their origin  in  local  interests.    In other words,  local questions  and disputes have  rendered  it  desirable,  in  the  view  of interested  parties,  that  the  statute  should  be  amended  in  its  provisions  applicable  to  such  cases,  and  at  the  next session  of  the  legislature,  such  amendments  have  been  incorporated  into  the  existing  laws,  often  without  due consideration;  and  hence  the  numerous  mutilations  which  have  so  frequently  created  a  necessity  for  a  new digest of the statute laws. In a community of intelligent freemen, too much importance cannot be attached to the general diffusion of a knowledge  of  the  laws  of  the  State.    The  statute  should  be  in  every  school  district,  and,  as  far  as  may  be,  in every family.  The legislature, in the act of November, 1850, providing for a new compilation of the laws of the State, evidently had  reference  to a digest which should be adapted  to  the capacity and  the means of  the greatest number,  and  be  extensively  distributed  among  the  people.    The  publisher,  encouraged  by  the  officer  charged with the supervision of the work, adopted measures for securing an extensive sale, so that probably at no period of  our  history  has  the  Vermont  statute  been  so  extensively  possessed  and  read  by  our  citizens  as  it  is  a  the present time. This  volume  contains  what  are  now  the  statute  laws  of  the  State,  except  as  they  were  to  a  slight  extent modified by the legislature of 1851, and if the assumption is correct that a knowledge of the laws is essential to the best interests of the whole community, it follows that alterations and amendments of the statute laws should be  made  cautiously,  and  only  in  view  of  the  most  obvious  and  urgent  reasons.    For  many  years  to  come,  and until  necessity  shall  compel  the  legislature  to  order  a  new  compilation,  the  present  volume  will  be  read  and referred to by great numbers of our citizens, as containing the Laws of Vermont; and comparatively few, except professional men and public officers, will be  fully  informed  in  regard  to  the alterations and amendments which may from time to time be adopted. In view of  the  foregoing considerations,  it  is  respectfully submitted whether  true economy and  the safety of the  State  do  not  require  the  adoption  of  the  usage  prevailing  in  most  legislative  bodies,  of  ordering  all  public bills, at some stage of  their progress, prior  to  their  final passage,  to be printed  for  the use of  the members.   The experience  of  every  practical  legislature  will  bear  testimony  that  without  this  precaution  it  is  in  most  cases difficult,  and  often  wholly  impracticable,  with  a  great  majority  of  the  members,  to  judge  of  the  necessity  or utility of the bill, or of its practical effect upon the code of existing laws. The  people  of  this  State  have  ever  been  awake  to  the  importance  of  common  schools,  and  have  sustained these  institutions  by  direct  and  voluntary  taxation, with  a  spirit  of  liberality  highly  commendable.    Probably  in few other communities is there felt a greater solicitude among parents for the instruction of their children in the common  branches  of  education.    Unworthy  exceptions  exist  to  this  general  remark,  but  it  is  apprehended  that those exceptions are comparatively few. It  is  admitted  that  serious  evils  and  sad  mistakes  exist  in  many  of  our  towns  and  school  districts  in  the administration  of  the  present  system,  by  which  the  benefits  of  common  school  instruction  are  greatly diminished,  and  in  some  cases  wholly  lost.    The  friends  of  education  have  had  their  attention  called  to  the existence of  these evils, and much discussion has been had as  to  the best method of correcting them.   Whatever shall  tend  to  the  better  qualification  of  teachers  –  whatever  shall  more  effectually  awaken  the  attention  of parents  and  prudential  committees  in  the  several  districts  to  the  importance  of  elevating  the  standard  of instruction and improving the character of each school under their immediate control, should be cherished as the appropriate means for correcting existing evils and bringing the system to its highest degree of usefulness. The  provision  in  the  present  school  law  for  holding  teachers’  institutes  in  the  several  counties,  under  the supervision  and  direction  of  the  State  superintendent,  is worthy  of  a  practical  test,  as  a means  of  improvement for great numbers of teachers. Schools  of  different  grades  of  instruction  are  provided  for,  in  the  present  law  relative  to  the  union  of districts,  which  provision  is  adapted  to  the  condition  of  the  more  populous  towns,  while,  by  the  more  general labors  of  the  superintendent,  it  is  believed  a  deeper  interest  may  be  created  throughout  the  community,  in measures which have been found effectual in contributing to the increased utility of schools. I  am  not  aware  that  at  this  session  of  the  legislature  any  essential  modification  of  the  present  law  will  be asked for, and it is respectfully submitted whether the interest of general education will not be best promoted by allowing  the present  law  to  remain unaltered, until, by  a  faithful compliance with  it provisions,  it  shall become evident that it has failed to meet the wants of the community. Our  collegiate  institutions,  and  many  of  our  academies,  sustain  a  creditable  rank,  when  compared  with kindred  institutions,  and  should  be  cherished  and  sustained  as  a  part  of  our  system  of  education,  and indispensable to the highest development of the Vermont mind.  As far as practicable, the way should be opened for a collegiate education, as well to the youth of the humblest family, as to him of wealthy parentage. Pursuant to a resolution adopted by the legislature, at the session of 1848, the Executive appointed Professor Z. Thompson  to  collect  the minerals,  field  notes,  and  other materials  of  the  geological  survey  of  the State. Mr. Thompson’s report, with a description of the materials referred to, was published in the Appendix to the Journal of the House for 1849. Should  no  measures  be  adopted  for  a  further  prosecution  of  any  survey,  it  may  be  expedient  to  appoint  a committee, charged with the duty of making a final disposition of the materials of the survey, and closing up its concerns;  and  also,  of  conferring  with  Mr.  Thompson,  relative  to  the  publication  of  further  information, touching the geology of Vermont. In  this  connection,  I  would  respectfully  call  your  attention  to  the  desirableness  of  early  measures  for procuring the publication of a correct map of the State. The  policy  heretofore  prevailing,  in  regard  to  banks  and  banking, was,  at  the  last  session  of  the  legislature, changed,  by  the  adoption  of  a  general  banking  law.    A  sufficient  length  of  time  has  not  elapsed,  to  afford evidence of  its adaptation  to  the wants of  the community.    If  it  shall be  found sufficient  to provide a sound and safe currency, for facilitating the business operations of the State – if it shall prevent extravagant issues, and the perversion of banking  facilities  to speculations foreign  to  the business of banking,  the  interests of  the State will require  its  continuance.   On  the  contrary,  should  it,  after  a  sufficient  trial,  fail  in  these  particulars,  it  should  be repealed.  A sound discretion would suggest that no hasty decision, adverse to the system, should be made, until experience shall indicate a necessity for abandoning it.  It is highly creditable to the chartered banks in operation in this State, that during every financial crisis their credit  has  been  sustained,  and  at  the  present  time  their  notes  are  regarded  by  the  commercial  community  as among  the  safest  in  circulation.   But while  it  is  a  gratifying  consideration  that  nothing  has  transpired  to  impair public  confidence  in  the  integrity  and  sound  discretion  of  those  in  the  direction  and  management  of  these institutions, no consideration should induce the legislature to relax in the enforcement of the provisions made by law for a constant supervision of their affairs. The  construction  of  railroads,  which  has  been  prosecuted  with  such  unparalleled  energy  and  perseverance, during  the  last  few years, has  tended  to develop  the  resources and capabilities of  the State,  to an extent beyond the  most  sanguine  expectations  of  the  projectors  of  these  enterprises,  and  the  system  may  now  be  regarded  as among  the greatest benefactions of  the  age.   Thus  far, however,  the  investments  for  such  construction have not yielded  a  fair  income  to  the  stockholders,  many  of  whom  have  been  subjected  to  no  little  pecuniary embarrassment by the losses they have sustained; but it is believed that the several railroads within the State are in  a  situation  to  be  operated with more  safety  and  economy  than was  practicable while  in  an  unfinished  State, and it may be hoped that with the increasing business, so clearly in prospect, better profits will be realized. A digest of laws, embracing a general system of provisions applicable to railroads and railroad corporations, was carefully prepared by a committee appointed by the legislature, and, after mature consideration, adopted by the  act  of  Nov.  1849.    It  is  not  supposed  that  any  further  general  provisions  are  needed,  either  in  view  of  the rights of the corporations, or the safety of the public.  A digest of the laws on any subject, or a system of policy adopted  after  mature  deliberation,  should  not  be  changed  until  experience  has  developed  its  benefits  and defects, and then, not by partial legislation, usually intended to remedy some fancied inconvenience, which may mar the symmetry of the whole system. Exceptions  to  this general  remark may obviously be entertained,  for  reasons clear and  tangible, and as  such exception, I would recommend the single additional provision, that in the future construction of railroad bridges –  except  when  the  rail  track  is  laid  upon  the  top  of  the  bridge  –  and  of  all  public  and  private  bridges,  under which trains of cars are to pass, the height of the truss shall be at least seventeen feet in the clear.  The frequent occurrence  of  accidents,  usually  fatal,  occasioned  by  bridges  being  so  low  as  to  sweep  from  the  top  of merchandise  cars  the  conductors  or  brakemen  who  happen  incautiously  to  be  standing  thereon,  suggests  the duty of providing by law for the only sure preventive of this class of accidents. The views of  the citizens of Vermont on questions of national  interest are  too well understood  to require on the  present  occasion  a  specific  enumeration.   A modification  of  the  present  tariff  is most  obviously  demanded, as essential  to  the prosperity and best  interest of  the American people.   The principal element which constitutes the  wealth  of  the  nation  is  labor.    The  great  body  of  the  people  are  directly  employed  in  productive  industry.  That  industry  should  be  stimulated  and  its  productions  protected  by  the  fostering  hand  of  the  general government. Without  increasing  the  amount  of  revenue  beyond  what  is  required  for  defraying  the  expenses  of government, adequate protection may be effectually secured, by a judicious discrimination in favor of articles of American growth and American manufacture, in the assessment of specific duties on foreign importations.  The encouragement  of  domestic  manufactures  and  mechanical  trades  is  essential  to  that  division  of  labor  which creates  a  home  market  for  the  surplus  products  of  the  soil,  which  in  turn  is  reciprocated  by  the  home  market existing  for  the  manufactured  article;  while  a  laudable  competition,  open  to  all,  is  sure  to  bring  the  price  of every commodity to its proper level, and to regulate and control the prices of imported fabrics. The  importance of a home market cannot be  too highly appreciated, especially by  the producing classes.    It saves  the  friction  and  expense  of  transportation,  equalizes  the  circulating  currency,  and  by  its  constancy prevents  in  a  degree  those  financial  revulsions  consequent  upon  overtrading with  foreign  nations.    It  promotes that  fraternal  intercourse  between  different  communities  of  the  same  State,  and  the  citizens  of  different  states, which  is  essential  to  the perpetuity of  the Union, and  to  that equality of  station, which  is  the  crowning  element in our republican organization. It  is  perhaps  supererogatory  to  remind  you  of  the  duty  of  strict  economy  in  the  exercise  of  your  official functions.   While a parsimonious withholding of appropriations  for objects  identified with  the prosperity of  the State,  and  clearly within  the prescribed duties of  the  legislature, would  ill  accord with  the  spirit of  the age, and the  well  known  wishes  of  an  intelligent  constituency  –  on  the  other  hand,  a  lavish  expenditure,  in  the administration  of  a  government  supported  by  direct  taxation,  is  inconsistent  with  a  proper  regard  for  the interests of the people.  It is respectfully suggested that in the absence of many of those exciting subjects which often  occupy  the  attention  of  the  legislature,  the  present  session  can  hardly  fail  to  be  of  comparatively  short duration, and of course less expensive than usual. It  is,  gentlemen, with  entire  confidence  in your wisdom,  ability,  and  integrity,  that  I pledge you my  sincere co-operation in the discharge of the responsible duties reciprocally devolving upon the legislative and executive departments during the term of our official relations.        Montpelier October 16, 1852.    ERASTUS FAIRBANKS.
