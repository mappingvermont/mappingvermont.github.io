Inaugural address of  Ryland Fletcher  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  October Session     1857     Friday, October 9, 1857 Inaugural Address.  Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  and House of Representatives:   I welcome you  to  the commencement of  the  labors of another year  in behalf of  the people of Vermont, who have committed their public affairs to our care. I  cannot  fail  to  congratulate  you  upon  the  continued  material  prosperity  and  general  health  of  our  people, and  to  express  the  confident  hope  that  the  peace  and  happiness,  the  morality  and  intelligence,  which  have  so long  characterized  and  distinguished  the  inhabitants  of  the  State  of Vermont, may  suffer  no  diminution  among us  hereafter.  For  these  manifold  blessing  we  cannot  be  too  grateful  to  that  divine  Providence,  by  whose  favor we enjoy  them all. With a  fervent solicitude  that all our deliberations and actions may  result  in  the  true welfare of  our  constituents,  and  above  all,  that  they  may  accord  with  the  dictates  of  an  enlightened  public  conscience and  His  recorded  will,  “in  whom  we  live  and  move  and  have  our  being,”  let  us  reverently  assume  the  high responsibilities cast upon us.   The  legislative  action  of  last  year  in  establishing  a Board  of Education will,  in my  opinion,  if  sustained  by future  legislatures,  prove  of  great  public  benefit. That  vital  interest  of  a  State,  the  education  of  its  people,  by  a thorough attention to which its free institutions can alone be preserved, will by the provisions of that enactment be placed under  the  continued  and  systematic direction of  a board of men  aware of  the great  importance of  the subject  committed  to  their  charge,  and  conversant with  the wants  of  the  community  in  that  respect. Without  in the  least  taking  the  practical  supervision  of  public  education  away  from  the  people  themselves,  to  whom  it  of right belongs and by whom it can be best exercised, but in reality only aiding and encouraging their efforts in its behalf,  it  is  confidently  expected  that  by  the  Board  of  Education  an  organized  system  of  operations  will  be devised, and energy and order infused into all public action upon this subject. In  conformity  to  the  organic  act  of  the  Legislature,  the Board  entered  immediately  upon  their  labors.  They were at  first embarrassed on account of  the apparent  inadequacy of  the prescribed salary of  the Secretary  to  the labor  and  expense  necessarily  attendant  upon  the  proper  discharge  of  his  duties.  But  they  were  fortunately relieved  from  this  embarrassment  by  the  generous  offer  of  the  managers  of  all  our  railroads  to  pass  the Secretary,  in his necessary visits  to  the different parts of  the State over  their  roads,  free of charge.  I gladly  take this  public  opportunity  to make  known my  grateful  sensibility  of  the  generosity  of  this  act,  and  to  express my hope  that  the managers  of  our  railroads, which  have  so  greatly  contributed  to  the wealth  and  prosperity  of  our State,  may  ever  give  that  encouragement  to  the  cause  of  popular  education,  which  will  in  turn  show  its beneficent  effects,  as  well  in  connection  with  the  particular  branch  of  mechanical  and  financial  science,  in which they are engaged, as in every other department of industrial and intellectual activity. J. S. Adams, Esq., of Burlington,  was  appointed  Secretary  of  the  Board.  His  report,  containing  a  valuable  array  of  facts  and suggestions,  will  be  laid  before  you,  and  I  bespeak  for  it  your  careful  attention.  Justice  to  a  faithful  public officer  requires  me  to  state  that  the  zeal  and  energy,  with  which  he  has  discharged  the  laborious  duties  of  his office, merit the lasting gratitude of our people. I am confident  that  the people of Vermont  look with a growing desire  for  the  revival and encouragement of a thorough and well organized Militia system. The legislation of last year in this direction has already favorably resulted in the formation of several uniform companies in different parts of the State. I have had the pleasure of witnessing  some  of  these  companies  on  parade,  and  have  greatly  admired  their  tasteful  and  appropriate uniforms,  their  good  discipline  and  soldier-like  appearance.  They  reflect  credit  upon  themselves  and  honor  on the State. If their services should ever be called into requisition, I should rely with confidence upon their fidelity to  a  soldier’s  duty.  The  efficient  labors  of  the  Adjutant  and  Inspector  General  during  the  past  year,  in encouraging  and  assisting  the  re-organization  of  the  Militia,  are  deserving  of  high  commendation.  The  free sentiments of the people of Vermont justly cause them to look with disfavor upon a standing army. But in these changeful times, and in the peculiar relations which the different sections of our country bear to each other, and which  the country at  large  sustains  towards  foreign nations,  the occasion may arise  requiring an armed  force  in our  midst  to  protect  us  from  domestic  dissention  or  foreign  invasion.  In  such  an  unfortunate  event,  the  surest safeguard  for  our  cherished  liberties,  will  be  found  in  a  patriotic  and  well  disciplined  citizen  soldiery,  which, being one in interest and sympathy with the people, can never be used to oppress or harass them. I  earnestly  recommend  to  you  the  continuance  of  the  existing  laws  prohibiting  the  sale  of  intoxicating drinks.  I  am  confident  that  the  prohibition  of  this  demoralizing  and  destructive  traffic  meets  with  the  cordial approval  of  a  large majority  of  our  people,  and  that  it  has  accomplished  and  is  still  accomplishing  a  great  and good work in arresting the evils of intemperance. The Railroads of Vermont, though of inestimable value in developing the agricultural and mineral resources of  the  State,  have  yet  generally  proved  unprofitable  to  those  by  whose  energy  and  enterprise  they  were constructed.  In  some  instances  the mortgages given  to  secure  the payment of  their bonds have been  foreclosed, and  the  original  corporations  divested  of  all  interest  in  them.  In  other  cases  legal  proceedings  have  been commenced  to  accomplish  a  similar  result.  The  legal  interest  and  management  of  most  of  our  railroads  will thus,  in  all  probability,  soon  be  vested  in  trustees  under  mortgages,  while  the  equitable  interest  and  real ownership  will  be  in  the  bondholders.  I  think  it  desirable  that  some  general  law  be  enacted,  providing,  with suitable  restrictions,  that  in  such  cases  the  bondholders  may  form  themselves  into  new  corporations  for  the management and operation of their respective roads, and that they may enjoy all the privileges and franchises of the  old  companies.  Such  an  enactment  will  obviate  the  necessity  of  applications  to  the  Courts  of  Chancery  on the  part  of  the  bondholders,  to  be  put  into  the  possession  and  use  of  their  respective  roads,  and  thus  save expensive  and  perhaps  protracted  litigation.  A  general  law,  such  as  I  have  suggested,  would  have  the  good effect  of  placing  the management  of  our  railroads  in  the  hands  of  their  real  owners, which would  undoubtedly result  in  their  more  prudent  and  profitable  operation.  Moreover,  a  responsible  party  would  thus  be  brought within  the  reach of  the  laws  in case of mismanagement.  It might also be made  to add  to  the  taxable property of the State,  as  the  bulk  of  the  railroad  interest,  being  now  composed  of Bonds, which  are mostly  owned  by  non-residents, is exempt from taxation. I  commend  to  your  vigilant  examination  not  only  the  general  laws  of  the State  in  regard  to Banks,  but  also the  present  condition  of  each  one  of  those  important  institutions.  The  country  is  at  present  bending  under  a financial  storm  unsurpassed  for  many  years.  Nothing  can  more  certainly  prevent  this  crisis  from  becoming appalling,  than  a  firm  conviction  in  the  public  mind  that  the  banking  institutions,  with  which  the  wealth  and credit of the community are so intimately connected, are perfectly sound and reliable. Every possible precaution should  be  taken  that  the  confidence  so  long  bestowed  by  the  public  upon  the Banks  of Vermont,  should  at  this trying period, be both deserved  and  sustained. No  surer means  can be  adopted  to preserve  this  confidence,  if  it is, as I am convinced, well merited, than a more than usual thoroughness in the examination and reports of their respective conditions.  If any  imperfection exists  in  the general  laws  regulating banking, or  in  their enforcement and operation  in  regard  to particular banks,  the defect ought  to be promptly  remedied, and wide-spread disaster will be thus happily avoided. Whatever  you  can  consistently  do  to  elevate  the  profession  of  Agriculture,  and  promote  that  commanding interest of  our State, which  is  the  source of human  subsistence,  and  therefore  lies  at  the  foundation of  all other branches of the public economy, will, I trust, receive your cordial approval. The Report of the Superintendent of the State Prison will be laid before you, and will, I presume, receive the attention which  the  importance of  that public  institution  to  the well-being of  the State  requires. The  true aim of prison discipline  is not,  I conceive, merely  to punish  the offender, or by  imprisonment  to  restrain him  from  the commission  of  crime,  by  also  by  consistent  reformatory means  to  prepare  him  for  a  re-entrance  into  society.  I deem  it worthy of enquiry by  the Legislature, whether a greater amount of moral  instruction,  than  the prisoners receive  under  existing  regulations,  will  not  tend  to  advance  the  great  ends  of  all  human  punishment,  the reformation  of  offenders  and  the  prevention  of  crime.  In  this  connection,  I  feel  that  I  should  be  remiss  in  the performance  of  my  duty,  did  I  not  urge  upon  you  the  pressing  necessity  for  some  separate  and  peculiar provision  for  the  punishment  of  juvenile  offenders.  Institutions  for  this  purpose  have  been  established  in many of  the  States  of  the  Union,  and  from my  investigations  I  am  convinced  they  receive  the  cordial  support  of  the communities  where  their  influence  has  been  properly  tested.  I  believe  the  conviction  has  become  general  in Vermont,  also,  that  this  subject  demands  legislative  action.  Prosecuting  officers,  judges  and  jurors,  are frequently  heard  to  express  their  perplexity  how  to  deal  with  young  offenders;  the  law  directing  them  to  one course,  while  their  sense  of  right  and  all  the  best  feelings  of  their  natures  prompt  another.  At  present,  a  child, which  detected  in  crime,  is  either  discharged  from  motives  of  pity,  by  which  exemption  from  punishment  he may  be  encouraged  to  a  continued  course  of  guilt,  or  he  is  incarcerated  in  the  jail  or  penitentiary,  where  the idleness  of  the  one  and  the  infamy  and  depraved  associates  of  both,  rapidly  ripen  him  into  the  hardened  and abandoned villain. Surely, one or more public  institutions under  the  supervision  of  the State,  the  future  destiny of  which  will  in  some  measure  be  affected  by  the  character  of  each  one  of  the  rising  generation,  some  wisely devised  house  of  combined  correction  and  instruction,  adapted  to  lead  him  back  to  the  paths  of  virtue  and usefulness, seems alike the dictate of wisdom and humanity. It is quite probable, that owing to the fortunate lack of  destitution  and  crime  among  our  people,  in  comparison  with  the  more  thickly  populated  portions  of  the United  State,  institutions  of  this  kind  cannot  be  advantageously  sustained  in  every  county.  In  this  case,  fewer Houses of Correction would be required, and a larger extent of territory might be accommodated by each than is comprehended  within  any  of  our  county  organizations.  I  would  further  suggest  for  the  consideration  of  the Legislature  the propriety of authorizing proper moral  instruction  in our jails, under  the direction of  the keepers. A  feeling of  respect  for humanity  is pained by  the  thought,  that any one who bears  its  image, however  low and degraded,  should  be  left  like  an  outcast  from  the  human  family, without  an  effort  to  improve  and  elevate  him. Sympathy for the unfortunate lies deep in the hearts of the people of Vermont, and they have never suffered it to be appealed to in vain. No branch of my official duty has been more agreeable  to me  than  that of ministering to the indignant deaf, dumb  and  blind  children  of  the  State  the  charity  which  our  laws  have  so  bountifully  extended  to  those unfortunate beings. Under the generous provisions of our Statutes in this respect, more than thirty children have received  instruction  during  the  past  year,  at  the  American  Asylum  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb,  at  Hartford, Connecticut,  and  the  Perkins  Institution  for  the  Blind,  at  Boston,  Mass.  These  children  are  subjected  to  a thorough course of education in all the branches of learning taught in our Common Schools and Academies, and moreover  are  instructed  in  some  useful  kind  of manual  labor,  adapted  to  their  unfortunate  condition,  by which they  will  be  enabled  to  support  themselves  through  life.  Their  progress,  I  have  good  reason  for  knowing,  is creditable  to  themselves  and  the  State.  By  the  means  of  this  noble  charity  many  of  our  youths,  who  would otherwise  have  lived  and  died  in  intellectual  and  moral  darkness,  have  been  rendered  intelligent  and  useful members  of  society. The  annual  appropriation  for  this  purpose  is  not  entirely  exhausted  by  those who  are  now enjoying  its  benefits. There  is  therefore  an  opportunity  for  the  education  of  a  few more  beneficiaries  from  this State, at each of said  institutions, and I hope,  if any cases of necessity for public aid  in  this respect exist among our people, application will be made to me in their behalf in the manner prescribed by law. In  conformity  with  the  Act  of  the  General  Assembly,  passed  at  the  last  annual  session,  to  provide  for completing  the  Geological  Survey  of  the  State,  I  appointed  Reverend  Edward  Hitchcock,  D.  D.,  of  Amherst, Mass.,  as  State  Geologist.  The  survey  of  the  State  has  been  prosecuted  by  Dr.  Hitchcock  and  his  associates during  the  past  year.  For  an  account  of  the  progress  and  result  of  the  survey,  I  would  refer  you  to  his  Report, which  will  soon  be  laid  before  you.  I  have  no  doubt  that  the  thorough  investigation  and  exploration  of  the geological and natural history of  the State, contemplated by  the act  referred  to, will  result  in valuable  scientific discoveries and great profit to the Commonwealth. In pursuance of the Act of the Special Session of the Legislature, providing for rebuilding the State House, I appointed Hons. George P. Marsh, Norman Williams  and  John Porter  a  committee  to  prepare  a  plan  according to  which  the  State  House  should  be  rebuilt.  These  gentlemen  have  discharged  this  duty  and  their  report  is submitted  to  you  with  this  communication.  I  appointed  Hon.  Thomas  E.  Powers,  Superintendent  of  the  work provided  for  by  said  act.  He  immediately  commenced  operations  and  the  work  has  thus  far  proceeded  with extraordinary despach. The present advanced state of the new building affords conclusive proof of the energy of the  Superintendent  and  his  peculiar  fitness  for  that  position.  I  congratulate  the  people  of  Vermont  upon  the agreeable prospect of  soon  having  a Capitol more beautiful  and  commodius  even  than  the  splendid  edifice,  the recent destruction of which we all so much lament. In  order  properly  to  discharge  the  duties  imposed  upon me  by  the  Act  of  the  last  Legislature,  entitled  “An Act  for  the  relief  of  the  poor  in Kansas,”  I  caused  full  inquiries  to  be made  into  the  condition  of  the  people  of that Territory. I directed the Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs to write to Hon. John W. Geary, at that time Governor  of  Kansas,  informing  him  of  the  action  of  the  Legislature,  and  that  I  stood  ready  to  extend  the  aid contemplated  by  said  act,  upon  proper  proof  of  the  existence  of  cases  of  necessity.  The  letter  of  the  Secretary, and  Governor  Geary’s  reply,  are  transmitted  to  you  with  this  document.  I  also  made  inquiries  of  numerous private  gentlemen,  well  acquainted  with  the  condition  of  the  people  of  Kansas,  and  used  every  means  I  could command  to  ascertain  whether  such  necessity  existed  as  would  justify  the  expenditure  of  the  appropriation.  I learned  from  various  sources  to  my  complete  satisfaction,  that  the  private  aid,  which  last  autumn  was  so bountifully  extended  to  the  oppressed  and  exhausted  people  of  Kansas,  by  the  charitable  and  liberty-loving citizens of the North, had been amply sufficient to satisfy the immediate wants of the poor of that Territory, and that  there  was  therefore  no  occasion  for  the  food  and  clothing  provided  by  said  act.  Though  no  portion  of  the money  thus  appropriated  has  been  expended,  I  am  still  proud  of  this  act  of  benevolence  on  the  part  of  the representatives  of  the  people  of Vermont,  and  I  shall  always  remember with  grateful  exultation  that  they  have placed  thus  publicly  upon  our  Statute  Book  the  evidence  of  their  sympathy  for  the  oppressed  and  destitute victims of the aggressive spirit of slavery. Nothing has occurred during the past year to diminish the indignation and alarm, which the great majority of the  people  of  Vermont  have  felt  at  the  rapid  increase  of  the  Slave  power  and  the  extravagant  nature  of  its demands. On the contrary, by the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Dred Scott, if the opinions of the majority of the Judges as expressed by them are to be received as law, there is little hope that the spread of Slavery will ever be stopped under our present form of government. By  that  decision  Slavery  is  no  longer  sectional;  it  is  made  national,  and  declared  to  be  recognized  by  the Federal  Constitution.  The  Constitution  is  said  by  its  own  force  to  carry  slavery  into  every  Territory  of  the Country,  and  any  act  of  Congress  or  Territory,  prohibiting  property  in  slaves,  is  pronounced  unconstitutional and void. This decision conflicts with  the  legislation of Congress  from  the  foundation of  the government down to  the year 1854, when  the  fruitful  source of all our woes,  the Kansas and Nebraska Bill, by northern  treachery and  the  insatiate  demands  of  the  South  for  an  enlarged  slave  market,  and  an  increased  political  power,  was sprung  upon  our  unsuspecting  people.  It  declares  unconstitutional  the  numerous  organic  acts  of  Congress, establishing  the  territorial governments of  the North-West Territories of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa  and Oregon,  the Compromise  of 1820,  and  the  act  for  the  admission of Texas.  It  contradicts  the opinions of  our most  eminent  statesmen  and  jurists,  expressed  for  a  long  series  of  years,  both  in Congress  and  from  the bench of  the Supreme Court, by Clay, by Marshall, and all  the  leading men of  the country both  from  the North and  the  South,  with  the  single  exception  of  Mr.  Calhoun,  deemed,  in  his  life  time,  even  by  his  fellow slaveholders,  as  extreme  and  fanatical  in  his  support  of  slavery.  Not  even  the  people  of  the  Territories themselves  are  allowed  to  exclude  slavery  from  their  midst;  they  are  doomed  to  its  withering  curse,  and notwithstanding  the  sounding  promise  in  the Kansas  and Nebraska Bill,  that  they  should  be  left  “perfectly  free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way,” they cannot, while in the territorial condition, shake it off. The great improbability that, when slavery has once planted its foot upon a Territory, it will ever be abolished, is proved by the impotent efforts of the best citizens of the older Slave States, to rid themselves of the system of slavery, which is degrading and ruining them. The logical results of this decision are alarming in the extreme, and may well arouse the freemen from their dangerous  apathy.  If,  as  declared  by  the  majority  of  the  Court,  the  Constitution  guarantees  property  in  slaves, and  prohibits  and  any  law  interfering  with  the  right  of  the  master  to  his  slave,  it  is  a  fair  inference,  if  not  a necessary  conclusion,  that  the  slaveholder  may,  for  purposes  of  pleasure  or  profit,  take  his  slaves  with  him  in his journeys through the Free States, and hold them here, notwithstanding the absolute prohibition of slavery by their  laws.  But  fortunately,  most  of  the  abhorrent  doctrines  enunciated  by  the  majority  of  the  Judges  were unnecessary  to  the  determination  of  the  case  before  them,  and  therefore  not  clothed  with  the  authority  of  law. They have been well  and boldly  characterized by one of  the dissenting  Judges,  the oldest member of  the Court and  the  only  surviving  associate  of  the  venerated  Marshall,  as  extra-judicial  and  of  no  binding  force  as authority.  I  am  sure,  when  one  of  the  Judges  themselves  use  this  indignant  and  unqualified  language,  that  the people of Vermont will not quietly  acquiesce  in  an unnecessary  and unauthorized declaration of doctrines  they have  always  loathed,  and  which  they  consider  hostile  to  the  genius  and  spirit  of  the  Republic  to  which  they belong. When, if the alarming prostitution of every department of the general government to the nefarious behests of slavery  shall  continue,  the  Supreme  Court  shall  declare  authoritatively,  what  they  have  already  foreshadowed, that  the  slaveholder  may  bring  into  the  Free  States  his  train  of  slaves,  and  hold  them  there  as  his  property, notwithstanding  the  absolute  prohibition  of  slavery  by  their  Constitutions  and  laws,  it  will  then,  in  that  day  of the  doom  of  the  Republic,  be  time  for  Vermont  and  her  sister  Free  States  to  consider    what  course  they  shall take  to  maintain  and  enforce  a  right  she  has  never  yielded  and  will  never  surrender,  the  absolute  and  total prohibition of slavery within her borders. My grateful acknowledgments are due  to  the people of Vermont  for  the honor  conferred by my  re-election. The  best  return  I  can  make  for  the  generous  confidence  reposed  in  me,  is  the  solemn  pledge  here  upon  the threshold  of  my  duties,  that  my  every  effort  shall  be  to  promote  the  highest  interests  of  our  cherished Commonwealth. RYLAND FLETCHER  Montpelier, October 9th, 1857.
