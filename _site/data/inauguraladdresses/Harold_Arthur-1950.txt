Inaugural address of  Harold J. Arthur*  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1950    *Harold W. Arthur became Governor when Governor Ernest Gibson resigned on January 16, 1950 to accept appointment as a U.S. District Judge.Monday, January 16, 1950 Inaugural Address  Friends and Fellow Citizens: Vermont’s  Constitution  which  I  have  sworn  to  uphold  provides  the  mandate  prompting  the  ceremonies  on this occasion. Today, with  the aid of Divine Providence,  I am assuming  the  responsibilities devolving upon  the highest  office  within  the  power  of  the  electorate  of  our  great  State  to  bestow.  For  this  signal  honor  and  rare opportunity  I  am,  indeed,  humbly  grateful.  The  decision  at  the  polls  in  1948  indicates  the  confidence  of  the voters  and  I  pledge  my  continued  effort  to  retain  that  confidence  in  assuming  this  sacred  trust.  Every  Chief Executive must necessarily inherit unfinished business and I am no exception to the rule. We have had a long line of good Governors, each burdened with the responsibilities appropriate to the times and  each  endeavoring  to  serve  in  accordance  with  the  will  of  his  constituents.  I  shall  continue  the  progressive movement  already under way  in keeping with  the Vermont  tradition. Calvin Coolidge  assures us  that  there  is a sufficient store of the spirit of liberty in these green hills of Vermont to replenish the lack of it in all other parts of  the  land.  This  same  philosophy  can  well  be  applied  to  thrift  and  ours  is  an  opportunity  to  promote  good, economic and efficient government. I  assume my  new  duties  unfettered  by  any  pledges  to,  and  uncontrolled  by,  any  group  or  individual.  After years of  legislative  experience,  study of government  and  constant observation of public opinion,  I have  formed definite  views  on  important  issues  and  the  kind  of  leadership Vermont  needs. As  time  passes  in  our  constantly progressive stride and as necessity requires, these opinions will be made known. The  financial  condition  of  the  State  is  reported  as  excellent.  If  the  predictions  made  become  a  reality  next June  30th,  I  am  confident  that  we  may  realize  the  various  goals  set  by  the  last  legislature  in  its  endeavors  to improve  roads,  schools,  health,  assistance  for  the  aged,  reforestation,  stream  purification  and  other developments  with  an  additional  direct  benefit  to  the  people  by  way  of  reduction  in  taxes.  Such  an accomplishment must  necessarily  be  supported wholeheartedly  by  the  coordinated  efforts  and  teamwork  of  all our  officials  and  employees.  Only  thus  may  we  realize  more  service  for  each  dollar  of  the  taxpayers  money. Cutting  needless  spending,  overlapping  of  department  functions  and  eliminating  useless  labor  will  be  constant aims during my administration. I  sincerely  hope  that  it  may  be  my  privilege  to  make  appropriate  recommendations  to  the  Legislature  of 1951. The loyal cooperation of every person is earnestly solicited in the interest of the general welfare and good government  and  I  emphasize  that  the  door  of  the  Governor’s  Office  will  be  open  to  all  of  the  people.  In accordance with  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of Vermont, with  the  help  of Almighty God,  I will  endeavor  to press forward with a strong heart and courage to do the right.
