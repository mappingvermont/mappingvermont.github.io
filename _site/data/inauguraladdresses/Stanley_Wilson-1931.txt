Inaugural address of  Stanley C. Wilson  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1931   Thursday, January 8, 1931 Inaugural Address   Members of the General Assembly: The  constitution  of  Vermont  provides  in  Chapter  II,  section  5,  that  “The  Legislative,  Executive  and Judiciary  departments,  shall  be  separate  and  distinct,  so  that  neither  exercise  the  powers  properly  belonging  to the others.” The  duties  and  powers  of  each  branch  of  the  state  government  are  carefully  prescribed  by  the  constitution.  It  will  be  my  purpose  as  governor,  in  accordance  with  my  oath,  to  perform  the  duties  cast  upon  me  by  the constitution  and  to  execute  the  laws  as made by  the Legislature.    It  is not my purpose or may desire  to  attempt to  interfere with  proper  legislative  action  by  the General Assembly  or  to  attempt  to  dictate  legislation  or  to  set my  judgment  against  that  of  the  Legislature  in  such  matters.    It  is  my  duty,  however,  to  lay  before  you  such business as I deem necessary. Best  results can be obtained by co-operation.    I assure you on my part  that  it will be my purpose and desire to  work  with  you  and  give  you  every  reasonable  assistance  within  my  power  to  the  end  that  the  purposes  for which  this Legislature  is convened  shall be accomplished  in a manner  to merit  the approval of our masters,  the people of the State of Vermont. Governor Weeks has already given you a  report of  the accomplishments during his  terms of office.   During that  time  Vermont  met  disaster  but  under  his  leadership  we  have  come  through  with  our  heads  up  and  with renewed  confidence  in  the  future.    The  few  suggestions  I  shall  make  to  you  are  not  revolutionary,  but  are intended to aid in the steady advance of our state now well started and to be continued through your acts. ECONOMY I urge upon you  the wisdom of economy  in making appropriations.   The money which you will appropriate must  be  obtained  by  taxation.   Whether  the  taxes  are  direct  or  indirect,  whether  the  payment  of  those  taxes  is immediate or deferred, the people eventually pay.  You should therefore consider in your legislation whether the condition of the people of the State will be made better or worse by the expenditures contemplated. Economy does not mean parsimony.   The State should be  just  to  its officers and employees  in  the matter of compensation.    The  State  should  provide  adequate  public  service  according  to  modern  standards.    It  should maintain properly  the  institutions which care  for our  insane and other unfortunates.    It  should  strive  to  improve our  schools  and  give  equal  opportunities  to  our  youth,  whether  resident  in  thickly  settled  or  sparsely  settled communities.  It  should  seek  to  improve  our  roads.    It  should  try  to  build  in  every way  for  the  future  on  a  firm foundation.    But  you  should  ever  keep  before  you  the  rule  that  you  should  not  tax  the  people  except  for  the public good. THE BUDGET Section 25 of No. 7 of the Acts of 1923 requires the Governor not later than the third Tuesday of the session to  submit  a  budget  “which  shall  embody  his  requests  and  recommendations  for  appropriations  or  other authorizations  for  expenditures  from  the  treasury  of  the  State  for  the  next  biennial  fiscal  period.”    The  budget has  been  prepared  and  I  expect  will  be  ready  for  presentation  to  you  as  soon  as  your  committees  are  ready  to consider the same. I desire  to call attention  to one  feature of  this budget.   Many of our departments and  institutions have more or  less  income  from  sales  for  farm  products  or  other  sources.    The  custom  has  crept  in  of  appropriating  for  an institution or department a stated sum “plus receipts.”  I deem this not good practice.  The appropriations should be for the entire expenditures and the receipts should go direct to the treasury as revenue of the State and not of that  particular  institution  or  department.    The  result  to  the  State  and  the  institution  will  be  the  same  but  the accounting  will  be  more  satisfactory.    This  change  will  make  many  of  the  suggested  appropriations  appear larger when in fact they are not.   In  considering  the  matter  of  appropriations,  I  trust  you  will  bear  in  mind  that  our  expenditures  must  be limited  to  our  revenues.    If  you  appropriate  beyond  present  anticipated  revenues,  it  is  your  duty  to  provide additional  taxes.    This  budget  will  require  the  same  taxes  we  now  have  or  other  taxes  producing  the  same revenue. AGRICULTURE Vermont  is  an  agricultural  state.    The  prosperity  of  Vermont  farmers  is  essential  to  the  prosperity  of  the State.    At  the  present  time  our  farmers  are  having  strong  competition.    The  State  should  give  them  every reasonable  aid  to  meet  this  competition  by  quality  products  and  more  economical  and  efficient  production, handling and marketing.    I  trust  the  recommendation  for additional  funds  for  the department of agriculture will be granted. The dairy  industry of Vermont  is  threatened with serious harm unless  the State can speed up  its work  in  the eradication of bovine  tuberculosis.   Not many years ago  the wisdom of  the  tuberculin  test was strongly debated in  these  halls.    Its  use  by  the  State  was  bitterly  fought.    But  times  have  changed.    Whether  tuberculosis  is communicable  from  cattle  to  human  beings  may  perhaps  still  be  debated,  but  in  view  of  the  action  of  public health  authorities  in  many  cities  and  states,  there  is  no  longer  any  question  as  to  the  wisdom  of  using  the tuberculin test as a business proposition.  When milk from non-tested cows cannot be marketed, the farmer must have his cows tested or go out of the dairy business.  We are confronted with that situation now.  Area testing is the economical way to handle the proposition after the individual herd testing has proceeded a proper distance. At the present time fifty-one towns in Vermont have been area tested.  Fifty additional towns have signed up for  the  test  which  cannot  be  given  until  funds  are  provided.    Moreover,  federal  appropriations  will  be  lost  to Vermont unless met before September 1.  Therefore, I recommend a large increase in the appropriation for area testing.  The appropriation for individual herd testing can be reduced somewhat. PUBLICITY Vermont has been getting a considerable  increase of desirable publicity of  late.   Her business opportunities, resources  and  scenic  wealth,  her  fine  cattle,  pure  milk  and  delicious  butter,  her  maple  sugar,  her  granite  and marble,  her  slate,  talc  and  asbestos,  her  apples,  seed  potatoes  and  her  crystal  pure  water,  her  good  hotels,  her good  roads  constantly  growing  better,  her  beautiful  lakes  and  trout  streams,  her  hills  and  mountains,  and  her unspoiled  people  are  better  known  to  the  residents  of  other  states  than  they  were.    People  are  coming  to Vermont in increasing numbers for vacations and permanent residence.  We must keep up or publicity work.  If possible,  we  should  increase  the  funds  employed  in  the  work  and  we  should  secure  better  cooperation  with private and commercial organization that are large advertisers. EDUCATION Considerable  progress  has  been  made  in  the  past  few  years  toward  equalizing  educational  opportunities  to the  youth  of  our  State.   Especially  has  there  been marked  improvement  in  the  condition  of  rural  school  houses and  the quality of  teachers  in  those schools.   The funds provided for equalizing  the cost of education have been insufficient, however, so that as a result the towns have not been getting that which they were promised.  These funds  should  be  increased.    Proposed  increases  in  overhead  can  better  await  a  later  day,  if  either  must  do  so because of shortage of available funds. HIGHWAYS Vermonters  have  reason  to  be  proud  of  the  progress  made  in  road  building  and  road  improvement  of  late.  With  the  increased  funds  available  from  motor  vehicle  registrations  and  the  tax  on  gasoline,  we  now  have  a large  sum  for  road  construction  after  maintenance  charges  are  cared  for.    Moreover,  or  road  builders  are constantly building better roads at a lower cost per mile. I have been greatly interested in the past few weeks to have access to publications showing how other states are dealing with the road problem and especially those states where, as in Vermont, the road mileage is high and the  population  and wealth  are  low  by  comparison.    I  find  that  these  states  have  been  developing  successfully  a low cost mud-free and dust-free hard surface road much  like  the  type of surface  treated or mixed  in place roads which recently have been tried out successfully in Vermont. This  is  neither  a  proper  time  nor  place  to  discuss  highway  construction.    I  believe  our  highway  department can be trusted to wisely spend the funds made available.  The extent of our road building is largely a question of money. I feel that you should provide funds which will enable us to increase the rate of construction of hard surface roads  and  at  the  same  time  give  more  attention  to  our  secondary  roads  and  town  roads.  We  must  provide reasonably usable roads or our farms will be abandoned.   We are poor compared  to most of our neighbors.   We cannot  fairly be  expected  to  compete with  them  in  road building.   But we  can go  ahead  so  that we  can  care  for the  needs  of  our  own  people  and  the  comfort  of  the  visitors  who  come  within  our  borders.    Both  must  be considered for both are essential to the future prosperity of the state. I  urge  a  careful  study  and  consideration  of  the  facts  and  figures  and  the  recommendations  contained  in  the reports  of  the Highway  department.    I  suggest  especially  that  greater  efficiency  and better  service will  result  if the State be given the care and control of main roads and that the time has arrived when this ought to be worked out on a fair basis. MOTOR BOATS The rapid growth of summer population around our lakes and ponds has created need for amendment of our laws  regulating motor  traffic on water.    It  seems  that  the motor vehicle department might well be given  charge of the subject. FISH AND GAME Fish and game are valuable assets of the State.  It is impossible to estimate accurately just how valuable they are  for  the  benefits  of  clean  out-of-door  sport  to  our  people  can  hardly  be  fixed  in  dollars.   We may  figure  the commercial  value  of  a  slain  deer  or  partridge  or  a  pound  of  trout,  but  we  cannot  say  how much  the  joy  of  the successful hunter or fisherman is worth. It  is good business for  the State  to foster and protect  its resources  in fish and game and we should endeavor to do it by business methods.  The attraction to the summer visitor and the summer resident is great. At  present  I  have  only  one  suggestion.    Experience  shows  that  frequently  emergencies  arise  caused  by drought  or  disease  or  local  conditions which  call  for  immediate  action  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  the State  in this  department.    I  think  you  should  give  authority  to  the  governor  upon  the  recommendation  of  the Commissioner of Fish and Game to deal with such emergencies by proclamation. STATE INSTITUTIONS In  general  our  state  institutions  are  in  excellent  condition.    One  exception,  however,  is  the  Vermont Soldiers’  Home  at  Bennington  where  extensive  repairs  are  needed.    This  will  probably  require  about  $30,000.  A  like  sum  is  required  for  heating  plant  repairs  and  improvements  at  the  Vermont  Sanatorium  at  Pittsford, where a new building was provided by an appropriation of the last legislature.  The State Hospital for the insane at Waterbury is getting badly overcrowded.  It seems that a fire proof building or addition to handle at least fifty additional patients with attendants, etc., should be provided.   The estimate  for such a building  fully equipped  is $125,000. In  this  connection  I  call  your  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  number  of  our  insane  and  feeble-minded  is constantly  increasing  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  burden  cast  on  the  communities  and  the  State.   We are  doing  our  duty  about  the  care  of  these  unfortunates,  but  practically  nothing  to  prevent  a  further  increase  in their  number.    Medical  science  points  out  one  definite  course  which  has  been  followed  successfully  in  some states. I  believe  it  is  folly  to  keep  erecting  more  buildings  for  our  feeble-minded  and  insane  and  yet  disregard ordinary business and social precautions.   The Supervisors of  the Insane  in  their biennial report recommend  the enactment  of  a  properly  safeguarded  sterilization  law.    You  will  do  well  to  give  this  matter  serious consideration. TAXATION For many years  there has been a growing belief  that our system of  taxation requires change  to bring  it more nearly  in  accord  with  modern  conditions.    Owners  of  real  estate  and  tangible  personal  property  have  felt  they were paying an undue proportion of the taxes.  Especially has this claim been made as to farm property and with a good deal of apparent reason.  Several legislatures have attempted to make changes without success. In 1925 a tax on intangible was enacted.  In 1927 this was amended so that I became in effect, if not in law, a  tax  of  62/3  percent  on  incomes  from  intangibles.    This  law  has  worked  an  improvement,  has  brought  into taxation  considerable  property  which  under  the  previous  confiscatory  tax  method  evaded  taxation,  but  due  to various  causes  it  is  but  partially  effective.    Apparently,  also,  there  are  serious  legal  questions  confronting  its future administration. You  have  already  had  called  to  your  attention  by Governor Weeks  the work  of  the  special  tax  commission which he appointed pursuant  to authority given him by  the  last  legislature.   The  report of  this commission  is an able document prepared by honest,  capable men  after  careful  study.    I  am  informed  that  from widely  divergent original  views,  the  commission  finally  became  unanimous  as  a  result  of  their  study  and  deliberations.    Their conclusions and recommendations merit your careful consideration. No  tax  system  in  actual use  anywhere  is perfect.   Theories necessarily give way  to  some  extent  to practical consideration.  The towns and the state must have the money to carry on the business of government.  But if you can accomplish a readjustment of the burden of taxation which shall be wise and accord with equity and do this without impairing revenues, you will have accomplished a real task. PRISON LABOR The  so-called Hawes-Cooper  law  enacted  by  the  70th Congress will  become  effective  on  January  19,  1934.  After  that  date  prison  made  goods  will  have  no  rights  in  interstate  commerce.    Such  goods  shipped  from Vermont  into  any  other  state will  be  subject  to  the  local  laws  of  such  state.    If  the  law  is  sustained  by  the U.S. Supreme Court, we shall be confronted with a serious situation as to the employment of the inmates of our State prison.    I  recommend  that  authority  be  given  proper  officials  to  study  the  problem  and make  report  to  the  next General Assembly. TAXATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMPANIES The  present  basis  of  taxation  of  public  utility  companies  and  especially  hydro-electric  companies  is unsatisfactory.    The  special  tax  commission  which  recently  reported  stated  that  it  had  examined  the  field somewhat  and  recommended  that  special  study  be  given  the  subject  either  by  a  legislative  committee  or  by  an interim commission.  I submit this for your consideration. BUS REGULATION AND TAXATION The  problem  of  bus  regulation  and  taxation  has  not  been  solved.    The  railroads  furnish  their  own  rights  of way  and  pay  heavy  taxes  while  they  are  driven  out  of  the  passenger  business  by  busses  running  on  public highways and paying comparatively nominal  taxes.   Moreover,  the menace  to  the  traveling public  from  the  law defying,  fast  speeding  inter-state busses  is great.    I am  informed  that  the  regular  schedules of certain  inter-state busses  going  through  the  state  are  such  that  to  keep  up  with  the  schedules  the  drivers  must  constantly  violate our law. Several  persons  have  already  been  killed  or  injured.    If  our  law  is  unreasonable,  it  should  be  changed.    If not, our officials should be given proper power to deal with the subject. FLOOD CONTROL The reports of the Advisory Committee of Engineers on Flood Control submitted to Governor Weeks give a great  deal  of  valuable  information  on  this  subject  which  is  of  interest  to  Vermonters.    Some  additional legislation to give the Public Service commission power to supervise action of this nature should be provided.  I believe we  should  look  carefully  into  this matter  but  not  go  too  fast.   The  State  should  endeavor  to  protect  the people  against  future  floods.    But  the  State  should  be  careful  also  to  protect  the  people  at  the  same  time  from giving  to public service corporations, under  the guise of  flood control,  rights  in our beautiful and  fertile valleys without adequate compensation both to the individuals concerned and to the State. Storage  reservoirs and power developments are not  things of beauty and  themselves uncontrolled may have as devastating  effect on a valley as an occasional  flood.   We  should not  sacrifice  the  cream of our  farm  land  to the development of additional electric energy unless satisfied that it will be beneficial to the State. The  State  of  Vermont  should  have  first  claim  on  the  electric  current  developed  in  the  State.    These developments  should  be  for  the  growth  and  betterment  of Vermont  and  not  be  the  sacrifice  of Vermont  for  the benefit of other states and communities. In closing,  let me say  that  I assume  the office of governor with a deep appreciation of  its  responsibilities.    I shall  need  your  advice  and  help  and  I  shall  not  hesitate  to  ask  it.    If  I may  aid  you,  it will  be my  privilege  and pleasure.  I trust we may work together for the best interests of the people of Vermont. STANLEY C. WILSON
