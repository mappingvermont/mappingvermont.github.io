Inaugural address of  Richard A. Snelling  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1981  Friday, January 9, 1981. Inaugural Address Madam  President,  Mr.  Speaker,  Mr.  President  pro  tempore,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  distinguished  officials  and servants of Vermont, guest and friends:  If  one  were  denied  access  to  all  of  the  written  texts  describing  the  history  of  this  nation,  save  only  the inaugural  messages  of  those  who  have  served  as  Governors  of  this  unique  and  marvelous  state  of  Vermont, from  those  messages  alone  one  would  gain  a  clear  view  of  the  blessings  and  tragedies,  the  opportunities  and obstacles which have shaped this nation and this state. Vermonters have always prided themselves on their independence.  From the earliest days of Windsor, those who  risked  all  to  form  the  Republic  of  Vermont,  quietly  and  firmly  declared  their  independence,  not  only  in government  but  in  character.    And  through  the  years,  the  Vermont  determination  has  been  to  cope  with  the challenges of the times, in ways specifically appropriate for Vermont and the Vermonters’ sense of values.  But we  have  not  been  isolated  or  estranged  from  the  destiny  of  America.    My  predecessors  have  seldom  listed agendas for Vermont which did not speak of the state of the nation in which those actions would be taken. Denied  access  to  the  Federalist  Papers,  a  Vermonter  could  learn  a  great  deal  about  the  nature  of  this  new union from Isaac Tichenor’s inaugural message of 1798.  The agonies and stresses of war are clearly revealed in 1813  by  Martin  Chittenden,  in  1861  by  Governor  Holbrook  and  in  1947  by  Governor  Gibson.    Difficult economic times and their effects on Vermont can be easily understood reading the words of Urban Woodbury in 1896  or  James  Hartness  in  1921.    No  less  fully  can  one  experience  the  exhilaration  of  the  eras  of  great expansion described by Horace Fairbanks in 1876 or John Bartow in 1882.  And  so,  even  as  tradition  calls  upon  me  to  speak  to  you  today  about  the  state  of  the  state  and  to  present  a sense of agenda for the legislative deliberation on which you embark, it calls also for me to attempt to relate the Vermont challenge to the national circumstance.  (The National Circumstance) I  believe we  are  approaching  the  end  of  a  dangerous  era  in American  history  and  that  as  a  nation, we  now face tasks as compelling and urgent as any we have ever faced. For  a  half  a  century, we  have  built  a  life  style  on  the  assumption  that  harvests  could  be  reaped without  the responsibilities  of  husbandry.  We  have  sought  to  repeal  fundamental  laws  of  economics  because  the  rate  of improvement in our circumstances which we could earn by our efforts, or from our savings, failed to satisfy us. For at least a decade some Americans understood that there would come a day of reckoning.  But even after, long after, common  sense  should have  told us all  that we could not escape  the  relationship between  supply and demand, between productivity and wealth, we continued to spend that which we had not yet earned. When  a  problem  in  some  segment  of  the  economy,  or  a  great  need  of  some  part  of  the  populace  disturbed our  sense at  tranquility or of plenty, we designed  a government program  to  “fix  it”.   When we  consumed more than we produced at home, we simply found ways to import.  When we could not pay for our imports, or for our spending,  we  sold  bonds  or  printed money.   When  we  experienced  recessions,  we  designed  so-called  counter-cyclical programs funded only by increased debt.  And so it is not surprising that the cycles of economic growth and recession have come to swing more severely and more dangerously. As we prepare  to  inaugurate  a new President of  the United States we  find ourselves with  interest  rates near 20 percent, with inflation well into double digits, with families needing homes which they cannot purchase even though  builders  need  work.  We  drive  on  highways  clogged  with  outdated  and  old-fashioned  automobiles inefficiently consuming gasoline which we must  import  from abroad while hundreds of  thousands of American auto  workers  are  unemployed  —  because  we  are  unable  to  compete  with  the  production  of  foreign  countries whose savings and investment have been triple our own rate. We will only be able to prepare for the future, if we understand that this year, 1981, is as much a watershed for our nation as 1865 or 1933. (Federal Funding Changes) I believe that in the next several weeks President Reagan will call upon all Americans to accept the burdens of  rebuilding a national economy, which can  truly and honestly support  the American dream of opportunity  for all.    We  will  be  asked  by  our  new  President  to  greatly  restrict  our  public  spending,  to  turn  away  from  over-reliance on debt as a  source  for  funding and  to  turn back  to  the people  responsibilities which were never safely entrusted to government.  And here, in Vermont, we must meet our needs and our obligations to all Vermonters within that context.                 It  is  not  in  our  best  long-term  interests  to  try  to  dissuade  the  President  or  the  Congress  from  trimming swollen  federal  expenditures.    Instead  we  should  plan  our  actions  and  our  expenditures  as  those  may  most wholesomely  respond  to  essential  changes  in  federal  budgets,  and  to  the  long  overdue  re-assessment  of  the proper roles of the federal government and of the several sovereign states. We must make sure that, in the process we do not turn our backs on those in need.  We cannot speak of such restraint  if  the  fortunate  are  protected  from  the  discomfort  of  such  restraint, while  the  poor  or  the  needy  suffer the full consequences. A  renewed  determination  to  make  sure  that  the  federal  government  addresses  only  constitutionally appropriate  federal  concerns  must  not  become  a  recipe  for  neglect  by  state  or  local  government  of  the responsibilities we claim are properly subject of “local control”. (The New Federalism) Vermont must demonstrate a willingness to specify those areas in which we are willing to accept reductions in  federal  grants,  either  because  we  are  willing  to  pick  up  that  responsibility  ourselves,  or  because  we  believe that  the  value  of  the  service  does  not  justify  its  expense  by  any  level  of  government.    We  must  assure  that remaining  federal  programs  will  give  us  sufficient  options  in  program  design  so  that  we  can  target  a  reduced amount of federal help to meet our own Vermont needs.  We must make sure that federal cutbacks result in less waste and not  less  social concern.   To accomplish  these goals, we will need  to demonstrate  that  the  legislature, the Governor, and the people of Vermont will face up to the responsibility of choosing among priorities. The National Governors’ Association  and  the National Conference  of State Legislatures have  jointly  called upon  the  executive  and  legislative  branches  of  all  states  to  sponsor,  in  each,  a  Convocation  of  Federalism.  These  convocations  will  bring  together  the  state’s  congressional  delegations  and  executive  branch  department heads  and  legislative  committee  chairmen,  to  help  define  and  describe  the  ways  and  means  by  which  we  can establish the appropriate federal-state relationship. I  hope  you  will  join  with  me  in  planning  a  Vermont  Convocation  on  Federalism  for  early  this  spring  or summer. (The Limits of Vermont’s Financial Capacity) The  budget  message  which  I  will  offer  you  later  this  month  will  be  largely  shaped  by  these  views  of  our times and the limits of our options. I  will  start  with  the  firm  assumption  that  we  can  and  must  manage  our  obligations  and  our  opportunities without any increase in broad-based, general fund taxes. That  budget will  then  recognize  that  our  own  general  funds,  even  though  they  are  already  limited, must  be used  in  part  to  fund  some  very  valuable  programs  which  were  formerly  funded  largely  or  entirely  by  federal grants. As  the  result of actions  taken  since  the  legislature adjourned  last  spring, we already know,  for example, that  funding  for  the  continuation  of  energy  audits  has  been  cut  by  one-third.    We  already  know  that  federal funding  for  the  entire  emergency  medical  services  program  has  been  eliminated.    We  know  of  substantial reductions in federal support of programs which seek rehabilitation of alcohol and drug abusers.   We know that comprehensive  employment  and  training  funds  have  already  been  cut  severely  and  we  know  that  law enforcement assistance, which  in  the past supported some valuable contributions  to our criminal  justice system, is  coming  to  an  end.    I  do  not  propose  that  Vermont  necessarily  pick  up  all  or  any  of  these  programs  in  the present  form,  but  parts  of  each  must,  in  my  judgment,  be  maintained.    I  will  ask  you  to  accept  funding responsibilities in each of these areas, because the services, at levels we can afford, are important to Vermont. (Our necessary Set of Priorities —) To  give  the  people  of  Vermont,  in  1981,  the  most  in  return  from  the  least  we  can  honorably  ask  then,  to contribute,  we  must  establish  as  our  priorities  those  programs  which  are  most  essential  to  their  fundamental rights as citizens. I suggest we set the following as priorities: (Education) First,  education.  We  can  make  superior  education  Vermont’s  specialty  and  its  fruits  a  more  valuable resource  than  oil  or  coal  or  even  gold.    Continued  strong  support  for  higher  education  institutions,  and particularly  for  scholarship  assistance,  is vital  even  in a budget of great  restraint. Vocational  education,  special education, adult basic education and special skills training programs can be decisive in earning for Vermont the opportunity  for  a  continued  trend  of  high  employment,  low  unemployment  and  steady  increases  in compensation for skilled jobs, so that Vermonters will not be disadvantaged in the national market place.  Even here, though these are priorities, I suspect that the budget proposals will fail to fully meet the expectations of the advocates and dedicated providers of these services.  (State Aid to Education Reform Needed for Equal Opportunity) But our highest priority  and our most powerful weapon  for  the  future  is  a public  elementary  and  secondary education  school  system which  assures Vermont  Children  the  opportunity  to  recognize  and  develop  fully  their individual potential.   Vermont can afford  the  total cost of  the best,  the most successful, public school system  in America.    Because  we  are  a  state  of  a  half  mission  people  situated  in  a  beautiful  but  mountainous  and  cold place, without  any  of  the most  vital  or  expensive mineral  or  energy  resources  of  our  time, we  cannot  afford  to fail  at  fully developing our human potential.    If we  are  to  remain  a  special  place, we must  triumph  by  our wits and our industry and our sense of values and priorities. I  believe Vermonters will  pay what  is  needed  to  build  such  a  school  system —  if  it  is  a  fair  burden,  fairly distributed.    Our  present  plan  for  funding  pubic  education  cannot,  however,  provide  for  equal  educational opportunity throughout the state. Some  towns  are  fortunate  to  have  both  a  large  tax  base,  consisting  disproportionately  of  non-residential property, and few children to educate.  In these towns generous school budgets can be passed while tax rates are kept  at  a  fraction  of  the  state  average.    And  in  these  towns  summer  homes  and  factories  and  ski  areas  escape their fair share of Vermont’s overall tax burden. At  the same  time, parents  in other  towns  find  themselves with many children  to educate and only  their own residential  or  farm  property  to  tax  and  they  must  often  choose  between  ruinous  tax  rates  and  barely  adequate, even inadequate, educational opportunity. For  this  there  is  no  solution  available  which  can  be  met  by  a  state  appropriation.    To  implement  the underlying  philosophy  of  providing  a  state-aid  fund  large  enough  to  provide  the  degree  of  equalization  which the Miller Formula was  designed  originally  to  achieve,  this  legislature would  need  to  appropriate  an  additional 60 million dollars to state aid, an amount equivalent to a 75% increase in income tax rates! I urge you to deal with the root cause of this problem.  First, please heed the recommendations made in this hall  by  a  host  of Vermont  governors who  preceded me  –  that  effective  legislation  be  enacted  to  assure  that  all property  in  Vermont  be  uniformly  appraised  at  100%  of  fair  market  value.    I  urge  legislation  which  will authorize  the  state  to  hire  competent  appraisers  to  perform,  at  the  expense  of  the  towns,  those  appraisals required because a  town  remains, after warning,  in contempt of  the present  law which  requires appraisals  to be at  100%  of  market  value  and  regularly  updated.    Second,  set  in  place  a  formula  which  establishes  a  state-aid trust fund based on a general fund appropriation at least as large as that appropriated for 1981, plus a sum to be raised by a uniform state-wide property  tax assessed on non-residential property.   Third, use  this opportunity  to eliminate  the  listing  and  taxing  of  inventory,  and  to  implement  a  board  public  policy  which  recognizes  the difference  between  theoretical  “market  value”  of  farm  and  forest  and  actual  use  value  by  legislating  that valuations of these properties be made at 50% rather than 100%. (Problem Interception — Alcohol Abuse) We  must  revise  the  basis  upon  which  we  invest  in  our  own  people.    We  must  recognize  the  treadmill  on which our present approach to certain social problems places us.  We now that alcohol and drug abuse are often a  contributing  factor  to  early  school  drop-outs.    We  know  that  alcohol  contributes  to  52%  of  our  highway fatalities.    We  know  that  large  numbers  of  our  chronically  unemployed  have  problems  with  alcohol  and  that their  problem  often  isn’t  that  they  can’t  get  a  job,  but  rather  they  can’t  keep  one.   We  know  that  a  significant percent  of  those  in  our  correctional  institutions  are  young  people,  who  have  dropped  out  of  school  and  who have problems with alcohol. We  pay  a  part  of  the  price  at  the  wrong  end.    We  pay  for  the  costs  of  incarceration.    We  pay  the unemployment costs.   We pay  the welfare costs.   We don’t, and can’t ever, pay  the costs of suffering — by  the victims  of  intoxicated  drivers,  victims  of  crime,  or  of  lives  wasted  in  despair  or  by  new  generations  raised without hope. Let us  recognize  the  limits of what we can do here, but nevertheless make a start  towards doing  something.  There  is  no  known  externally-imposed  cure  for  alcoholism.    But  experts  in  this  area  tell  me  a  sound comprehensive program might make a difference  for a quarter  to a  third of  those whose  lives will otherwise be most tragically distorted by this illness. I propose Vermont mount a pioneer model effort to reduce alcohol abuse.  First,  I propose the state general fund  continue  essential  programs  in  this  area  which  are  being  dropped  by  the  federal  government.    Second,  I propose  that  we  undertake  a  strong,  sustained  effort  to  communicate  to  the  general  public  the  nature  and  the social  costs  of  alcohol  abuse,  starting  in  the  schools.    Third,  I  propose  funding  an  alcohol-abuse  counselor  in each  of  the  state’s  eight  administrative  districts  to  coordinate  the  location  and  treatment  potential  of  all whose welfare,  or  unemployment,  or  criminal  problems  appear  to  be  largely  alcohol  or  drug  related.    I  propose  an expansion  of  project C.R.A.S.H.,  both  as  a means  of  removing  dangerous  drivers  from  our  highways,  and  as  a way of identifying those who need our help. And  finally  I  propose  the  state  fund  a  community  challenge  program  to  assist  communities  in  marshalling their  resources  and  efforts  to  deal  with  alcoholism  and  alcohol  abuse.  This  program  will  challenge  Vermont’s communities to devise new and imaginative methods for early identification and intervention in cases of alcohol abuse.   We will  provide  financial  support  for  those  communities which  design, with  state  assistance,  programs which offer real hope of showing us new ways of coping with the troubles caused by alcohol abuse. (The Safety and Security of our Citizens) I believe a sense of security of person and property is essential to the stability of our society. We must  see  to  it  that  our  criminal  justice  system makes  it  clear  to  those who would break  the  law  that we will not stand idly by or quietly tolerate violence which makes it impossible for us to live together as neighbors and friends.   Together with Vermont’s new Attorney General, I will propose a series of reforms  to our criminal justice system, the specifics of which will be announced within the next few days. Included  will  be  recommendations  to  increase  the  legally  authorized  sentences  for  certain  crimes  of violence, where  those  crimes  are  committed  against  the  elderly,  or where  firearms  are  involved. Also  included will  be  recommendations  for  lowering  the  blood  alcohol  level  which  gives  rise  to  presumption  of  impairment while  driving.    Both  the  Attorney  General  and  I  urge  you  pass,  for  the  second  time,  the  Constitutional amendment to our Bail Law. Although  many  more  towns  have  local  police  capacity  than  did  a  decade  ago,  and  even  though  some counties  have  considerably  strengthened  their  sheriffs  departments,  this  rural  state  still  must  count  on  the Vermont  State  Police  for  law  enforcement  to  a  very  considerable  degree.    Our  present  force  is  well  below  the strength  required  to provide  the protection and detection expected and  required of  it.   The burdens of arson and criminal  investigating  units  rise  at  the  same  time  the  responsibilities  for  local  patrol  and  highway  law enforcement also increase.  Therefore, I will recommend the most substantial increase ever in the strength of the Vermont State Police.  I will ask for sufficient funding to recruit, train and equip 50 additional troopers and will plan  to  locate  these  additional  men  and  women  with  particular  emphasis  on  expanding  the  outpost  system  so that we will have a grid of State Police officers strategically located throughout the state. During  the  past  two  years  the Department  of  Public  Safety  has  been  the  subject  of  intense  controversy  and concern.   But  throughout  that  difficult  time  the men  and women who make  up  the Vermont  State  Police  force have continued to do their jobs with a dignity and professionalism which deserves that their uniform continue to be  a  source  of  pride  and  respect.    They  spend  long  hours  at  difficult  and  dangerous work,  and  they  receive  all too little in the way of respect and recognition from those of us whom they serve and protect. (Economic Development and Employment Opportunities) Tight budgets do not  justify  a  lessened determination  to  invest now  in better  jobs  for  the  future.   We  list  as priorities our programs for strengthening our agricultural, manufacturing and recreational sectors.  I will ask for modest  expansion  of  the  program  for  agricultural  product  marketing  and  continued  support  of  Vermont Industrial Development Authority grants and bonding authority. We  also  list  as  a  top  priority  in  a  time  of  growing  fiscal  constraint,  adequate  funding  for  the  continued protection and management of Vermont’s environmental and natural resources. The  base  we  laid  down  in  the  70’s  and  have  build  steadily  upon  has  put  us  10  years  ahead  of  most  other states in the field of environmental management and it has begun to repay us handsomely. To encourage  the continued  recoupment of one environmental dividend,  last year we  initiated a program of matching certain additional private sector promotional efforts to increase our travel and recreation industry. For  every  dollar  invested  in  travel  promotion,  experts  tell  us  seven  dollars  are  returned  to  the  state  from increased  tax  revenues.    Accordingly,  I  am  recommending  a  self-liquidating  program  of  additional  state promotion of the travel industry. (Safe Highways) Although  the budget message  is  the proper place  to deal  in detail with  revenue and spending proposals, any list  of  priority  legislation  must  include  an  adequate  highway  system.    There  will  never  be  equal  economic opportunity  in  areas  isolated  from  the  rest  of  Vermont  by  unsafe  roads  designed  to  carry  the  traffic  of  half  a century ago. Because  of  events  beyond  our  influence,  income  to  the  highway  fund  falls  further  and  further  behind  that required  to  support  even  the  minimum  level  necessary  to  provide  such  a  system.    I  continue  to  believe  the people will support any fair schedule of  taxes on gasoline or vehicles necessary  to maintain safe highways, and I will recommend one such schedule to you. You  will  find  no  easier  or  fairer  way  to  solve  this  problem  than  to  face  it  squarely  by  providing  adequate revenues within the highway trust fund to pay the costs of services traditionally charged to that fund. (Our Obligations to Those in Need) In an austere budget, it is sometimes necessary to measure our priorities by our ability to continue programs rather  than  to enhance  them.   While  it  is  little solace  for  the provider or  the recipient of needed public services, it  is  true  in  times such as  these  that priority status may only provide  insurance  that a program will continue and not be cut back. In the area of welfare, the time has come and the opportunity has now been presented for significant welfare reform.    A  new  administration  begins  in  Washington  amid  a  growing  public  recognition  that  too  often  those who  work  and  pay  taxes  are  unable  to  afford  a  standard  of  living  as  satisfactory  as  that  provided  to  some welfare  recipients.    We  can  now  move  forward  with  the  reform  of  this  basic  inequality  and  seek  federal flexibility  to  assure  that  in Vermont, welfare  recipients who  can work will not be  encouraged  as  a  result of  the current  system  by  receiving  amounts  comparable  to  those  Vermonters  who  do  work.    Nevertheless,  it  is necessary to recognize that real need still exists for those who cannot provide for themselves and their families. Although the budget which I will present to you is austere, it is clear that a modest increase in ANFC (6% to be  specific) must be  included.   Such an  increase will  in no way place either welfare  recipients or working poor in a position  to be envied.   I know of  few more difficult or more  important  tasks  than  that required  to eliminate inequality and inequity between those who can and do care for themselves and those who cannot. It  is evident  that a 6%  increase does not fully compensate for  the ravages of  inflation.   But  it  is equally  true that  in  the  last  three  years  we  have  increased  the  average  welfare  benefit  in  Vermont  from  $379  to  $531  per month,  a  30%  increase,  and  those  increases  were  at  one  and  the  same  time  the  highest  in  the  northeast  and greater than the improvement in after-tax income of many wage-earners. I  will  also  be  recommending  to  you  that  the  state  begin  the  first  steps  toward  containing  Medicaid expenditures.    It  is  vitally  important  as  a matter  of  public  policy  that we  begin  to  bring  under  control what  has become the fastest growing single welfare expenditure of the past decade. (The State of the State) Your deliberations will face you with many difficult, sometimes painful choices.  Many of the problems you will be addressing will be facing legislators in every state of this union, as they meet in the months ahead. As perspective helps us to see our problems and our duties, it should also help us to see those ways in which we should count ourselves fortunate as we compare our burdens with those of others. Vermont is well prepared for the challenges of these times. As  long  ago  as  1976,  this  legislature,  faced with  receding  revenues,  broke with  tradition  by  determining  to reduce expenditures rather than increase broad-based, general fund tax rates. We’ve  been  improving  the  operations  of  the  machinery  of  government  for  four  years.    The  adopted recommendations  of  the  Cost  Control  Council  have  made  it  possible  to  wring  tens  of  millions  from  budgets which otherwise would be required to support the programs we manage. Since  1977,  we  have  voluntarily  amended  tax  legislation  to  reduce  tax  receipts  by  more  than  a  hundred million dollars. We will  not  be  starting  for  the  first  time  this  year  to  accustom  ourselves  to  living within  our means.   Over the past six years our state government budgets have decreased,  in  inflation-adjusted dollars, by at  least 21%  in relation to the income of Vermont’s taxpayers. In  those  same  six  years we  have  soundly managed  the  state’s  general  obligation  debt  and  have  reduced  the burden of that debt, as compared to personal income, by more than half. We approached the need to focus on future-building priorities with some experience.  We are already seeing positive  results  from  our  efforts  to  build  up  our  industry,  tourism  and  our  agriculture.    In  past  recessions,  even as recently as 1973 and 1974, Vermont entered recessions with unemployment higher than the national average, lost  a  larger  percentage  of  personal  and  governmental  revenues  than  the  national  average,  and  ended  the recession with more ground to regain than the people of other states. So  far,  in  the  recession  of  1980,  the Vermont  record  is  better  than  the  national.   At  the  start we  had  higher employment than ever before in history and our unemployment was lower than the national average.  Our work force and  the number employed have  increased  since  the  recession of 1980 began, and we have added a  record number of new jobs in manufacturing, so that our unemployment rate is now well below the national average. Your  tasks  in 1982 will not be nearly as severe as  they were for your predecessors meeting  in 1921 or 1935 or 1975. This Assembly’s appropriations for the fiscal year ending last June 30th reflected a common expectation of a national  recession  and  although  the  general  fund  accounts  reflected  a  small  deficit,  they  also  reflected  very substantial cash balances in funds to which earlier surpluses had been placed. Revenues  for  the  current  fiscal  year  started  somewhat  behind  expectations  as  to  the  timing  of  economic recovery, and  in response  this administration reduced expenditure outlays by up  to 3%  in certain budgets.   As a result,  the  so-called  “Budget-Adjustment”  Act  which  you  will  receive  shortly  will  not  ask  for  any  net supplemental appropriation for this year. I  am  pleased  that  overall  revenues  are  now  being  received  at  a  rate  which  will  fully meet  the  expectations for this year — reflecting for the first six months more than 10% more revenues than were received in the same period one year ago. I am confident there will be no general fund deficit facing you in this fiscal year. For all these reasons we are in a good position to face the future — and we should do so with determination and confidence. In  changing  times,  when  the  decisions  which  will  most  alter  destiny  must  be  made,  those  on  whose judgment outcomes depend often  find  themselves  torn with doubts.   That which  seems  clear  and  compelling  to one, appears to another as of little merit or certainty. In such times some will fail the test of history because they are sure that those with whom they disagree are of  less  noble  spirit  or  intent.    Others  will  fail  because,  unable  to  discern  in  the  morass  of  conflicting  opinions and  beliefs  a  course  of  action which  perfectly  reconciles  their  own  judgment with  that  of  others,  they will  risk no conclusion at all! I  believe  success  will  come  more  likely  to  those  who  can  perform  their  duties  with  the  advice  of  Justice Brandeis in mind. Brandeis wrote  “Some  questions  can  be  decided  even  if not  answered.   And  it  isn’t necessary  that one  side by wholly  right and  the other  totally wrong, because  that  seldom happens either  .  .  .  it  is enough  that  the  scales of  judgment  be  tipped  in  one  direction  and,  after  a  decision  is  made  .  .  .  one  must  go  forward  wholly committed.” I  am  confident  that  this  Vermont  General  Assembly  will  face  the  changing  times  of  1981  with  good  will, with  respect  for  all  the  opinions  which  must  be  heard  if  we  are  to  find  the  best  path  of  service,  and  with  the courage, once the scales of judgment have been read, to go forward, wholly committed to Vermont’s future.
