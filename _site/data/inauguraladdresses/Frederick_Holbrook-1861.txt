Inaugural address of  Frederick Holbrook  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  October Session  1861  Tuesday, October 22, 1861 Inaugural Address Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: –   It was  a great disappointment  to me  to be disabled by  sickness  from  entering upon my official duties  at  the opening  of  the  session  of  the Legislature.   Rising  so  recently  from  an  attack  of  illness, without  the  opportunity or physical strength to investigate to any considerable extent the public requirements of the State, I cannot make this communication so practical in detail, or complete in statement, as might perhaps under other circumstances have  been  realized.    The  deficiency,  however,  is  of  little  consequence,  inasmuch  as Vermonters  are  proverbial for  the  good  management  of  their  public  affairs,  and  a  quick  sense  of  the  proprieties  of  things  in  all  public transactions. The  returning  autumnal  season  has  again  brought  together  the  General  Assembly  to  consult  for  the  public welfare,  and  enact  laws  to  promote  the  same.    Looking  abroad  over  the  State,  we  observe  that  the  bounties  of Providence have been most generously dispensed,  and we  are  surrounded with  the evidences of plenty  in mart, in  field,  flock  and  herd;  that  the  people  have  prospered  in  their  undertakings  of  industry;  that  we  have  been exempt  from  pestilence  or  the  ravages  of  wasting  sickness,  and  that  the  domestic  security  of  society  has  been undisturbed.    For  these  and  other  blessings,  our  public  acknowledgments  are  eminently  due,  and  should  be gratefully expressed to the great Lawgiver of the Universe. The  inhabitants  of  Vermont  have  doubtless  preserved  as  much  of  our  early  American  character  and  of  the simplicity  and  purity of  free  institutions,  as  those of  any State.   They  are nowhere  excelled  for  the blessings of just  and  equal  laws,  by  general  intelligence  well  administered,  and  for  a  remarkably  equal  distribution  of property,  accompanied  by  that  frugality  and  thrift,  which  ensures  comfortable  homes  and  substantial independence to a large proportion of the population.  On somewhat stubborn, but strong and retentive soil, our bracing climate, and the necessity which nature here imposes for industrious, persistent labor, combine to train a people  capable  of  much  physical  endurance,  and  of  heroic  and  manly  deeds;  and  the  influences  of  climate,  of mountain scenery and the aspects of physical nature generally, stimulate the imagination, refine the sensibilities and  exalt  the mind.  “Freedom  and Unity”  is  their motto,  and  they drink  in  the  spirit of  liberty with  the  air  they breathe. From  a  statement  by  the  Treasurer,  published  in  the  Report  of  the  Auditor  of  Accounts,  I  gather  the following facts in regard to the standing of the State Finances on the 45h of September, 1861: RESOURCES $36,517 30  28,880  12 90,645 97 48,431 74 --------------- $204,475 13 $13,125 00 5,163 04 100,000 00 75,000 00 10,000 00 5,000 00 --------------- $208,288 04 Balance in the treasury and due from Banks, Due on Taxes voted before 1860,    “     “ Tax of 1860,     “     “     “ payable Oct. 15, 1861, Balance due from H.M. Bates,    $2,458 87 26,421 25 ---------------     Due Banks for contributions to Safety Fund, Balance due Towns for U.S. Surplus Money, Loan of 1857, due Nov.  1, 1862,        “     1859    “  Nov. 21, 1864,        “     1860   “   July.   1, 1862,        “     1860   “   July.   1, 1861,   LIABILITIES         123,000 00 -------------- 448,266 84  28,920 36 The  Treasurer  states  that  it  will  be  necessary  to  provide  means  for  the  payment  of  the  loan  of  1857,  of $100,000 00, at the present session of the Legislature. In  his  recent  valedictory  address,  my  predecessor  states  that  up  to  and  including  the  4th  of  October,  1861,  the amount of Warrants drawn by him upon the Treasury is $512,362 59   The Treasurer informs me that since the 4th of  October last, warrants have been drawn, in addition  to the above, to the amount of  Amount thus far expended in recruiting and fitting  out regiments for the service, From this may be deducted the amount reimbursed By the Secretary of the United States Treasury which  my predecessor states is  58,904 25 ------------- $571,266 84    Leaving the sum of To this may be added the extra pay of $7 per month thus  far disbursed by the Treasurer, And the amount disbursed on Governor’s warrants in aid  of soldier’s families,    1,866 13  --------------  $479, 053 33 There  are  other  liabilities  outstanding,  incurred  for  military  purposes,  the  amount  of  which  cannot  now  be definitely stated. In  attempting  to  make  an  approximate  estimate  of  the  military  expenses  of  the  current  year,  I  remark  that each  soldier  of  Vermont,  in  the  service  of  the  United  States  by  authority  of  the  State,  is  to  receive  from  this State the sum of $7 per month or $84 00 annually.  The amount to be paid them the current year will be about as follows: Five regiments of infantry, namely:  second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth regiments, supposed to average about one thousand men each at $84 each, the year,  The regiment of cavalry recruited by Col. Platt, under a  commission from the War Department, if by act of the  Legislature authorized to come under the provisions of  the act for raising six regiments for the service, passed at the special session in April last, and thus counted as  a part of the quota to be furnished by Vermont, will add about one thousand men, at $84 each, If, in order to make up the State’s quota, two more  regiments should be authorized, there will be about two  thousand men thus added at $84 each, Also, the expenses of recruiting, furnishing and fully preparing  them for service, say about $100,000 each regiment, $420,000 00 168,000 00 84,000 00           Making a total military outlay of about To the above may be added the State’s quota of the  United States tax on real estate, imposed by congress in August last, Making an estimated total expenditure for the current year, above the ordinary expenses of the State, of about,  200,000 00 ------------------ $872,000 00   211,068 00 $1,083,068 00 The above expenses may be lightened by further reimbursements from the United States Treasury.  In offset, Congress  may  impose  an  additional  tax  at  its  coming  session.    Of  these  matters,  however,  I  am  not  a  present sufficiently informed to speak advisedly; and yet it is deemed proper to direct the attention of the Legislature to them. From  the  above  figures,  not  claimed  to  be  an  absolutely  correct  statement,  but  supposed  to  approximate thereto, and bearing in mind the amount already expended since the appropriation made at the special session of the  Legislature  in  April  last,  it  will  be  seen  that  if  more  troops  are  to  be  sent  into  the  service,  a  further appropriation by the present Legislature will necessary. As before  remarked, Vermont has now  five  regiments of  infantry  in  the service of  the United States.   There is a regiment of cavalry now recruited in the State, by authority of the War Department at Washington, which, if authorized by special act of the present Legislature to come under the provisions of the act passed at the special session  in  April  last,  for  raising  six  regiments,  will  complete  the  number  of  regiments  then  authorized  to  be raised.  There is also one full company of sharpshooters from the State, now in the service; and there are one or two other companies of like character now recruiting.  If it is deemed advisable to place these companies on the footing  as  to  extra  pay,  &c.  already  authorized  for  other  troops,  further  legislation  will  be  necessary.    The State’s full quota of the national army, as at present indicated by Government, is about eight regiments.   As but six  regiments  have  yet  been  authorized,  further  legislation  will  be  required  before  additional  regiments  can  be raised and prepared for service.  I shall be happy to co-operate with the Legislature in any plans they may adopt in  this  direction,  and  respectfully  sugest  the  propriety  of  raising  at  least  two  more  regiments  for  the  United States service. The militia  laws of  this State are not  such as  the  times demand.   They are diffuse, of doubtful construction, and  quite  too  unwieldy  and  inefficient.    Recent  events  clearly  demonstrate  that  no  community,  however  free, can afford to repose in so defenceless a condition as the people of Vermont have been content with of late years.  There  is abundant  talent  in  the Legislature  to  investigate and compare  the best known systems, and  to perfect a compact,  perspicuous  and  effective  law,  out  of  which  shall  grow  a  military  organization  that  will  be  an  honor and defence to our State. In  August  last,  Congress  passed  an  act  imposing  a  direct  tax  of  $20,000,000  annually  upon  the  United States, to be levied upon real estate, setting to the State of Vermont the sum of $211,068 00 as its quota thereof.  The  act  provides  for  the  assessment  and  collection  of  the  tax  by  United  States  officers.    But  it  also  authorizes any  State,  through  its  own  officers  and  in  its  own  way,  to  assess,  collect  and  pay  its  quota  of  the  tax  into  the United  States  Treasury;  and  any  State  which  shall,  on  or  before  the  second  Tuesday  of  February  next,  and  at that time in each subsequent year, give proper notice to the Secretary of the Treasury of its intention to assume, collect  and pay  its quota of  said  tax,  shall be  allowed  fifteen per  cent. deduction  thereon,  conditioned  that  such payment  shall  be  made  on  or  before  the  last  day  of  June  in  the  year  to  which  such  payment  relates.    I  should suggest that you adopt the requisite measures to collect and pay the States’s quota of said tax, thereby saving the fifteen per cent. proposed in that case to be deducted by the National Government. A new census of  the United States having been recently  taken, articles four and  twenty-three of amendment of  our  State  Constitution  require  the  Legislature  to  make  a  new  apportionment  of  the  Senators  to  the  several counties, and they also prescribe certain rules regarding such apportionment. I  congratulate  you,  gentlemen,  upon  the  completion  of  the  Statue  of  Ethan  Allen,  by  our  promising  young artist,  Mead,  and  upon  its  safe  erection  in  a  fitting  place.    The  superior  quality  of  the  material  of  which  the Statute  is made,  illustrates  the  riches of Vermont  in  her  statuary marble.    It  is  a  rare  honor  to  the State  to  have furnished  from  among  her  sons  the  genius  and  talent  that  conceived  and  elaborated  this  finished  work  of  art.  We  can hardly  look  at  the noble  statue without  feeling our patriotism kindled  anew;  and observing  the  striking and expressive  face,  the majestic port and uplifted hand of  the old hero,  imagination pictures him commanding the  present  enemies  of  his  country  to  cease  their  attempt  to  overthrow  its  Government,  and  bidding  its  benign institutions to descend perpetually to posterity. The Reports of  the Trustees and Superintendent of  the Asylum  for  the  Insane  indicate  that  this  institution  is in  its  usually  flourishing  condition.    During  the  past  summer  the  wings  of  the  Asylum  have  all  been  raised another  story,  by  which  a  large  number  of  cheerful  and  commodious  rooms  have  been  supplied,  for  the  better classification  and  accommodation  of  the  patients.    The  unostentatious  and  untiring  devotion  of  the Superintendent  to  the  interests of  the Asylum and  the comfort and welfare of  its  inmates, afford as complete an illustration  of  active,  practical  benevolence  and  sympathy  for  a  most  unfortunate  portion  of  society,  as  it  has ever been my fortune to observe. The  Report  of  the  Bank  Commissioner  gives  assurance  that  the  Banks  of  the  State  are  safely  managed.  After  speaking  of  the  judicious  operations  of  these  institutions,  in  adapting  their  business  to  the  present  times, the  Commissioner  remarks:  “A  currency  that  can  withstand  such  a  financial  revulsion  as  that  which  we  have witnessed during the past year, is certainly entitled to great public confidence.” The  Report  of  the  Directors  of  the  State  Prison  informs  us  of  the  excellent  management  of  the Superintendent  of  the  institution.    It  appears  from  the Report  of  the  Superintendent  that,  agreeably  to  an  act  of the  legislature  approved  October  30,  1860,  appropriating  $2,500  for  the  rebuilding  of  the  east  shop  of  the institution,  a  substantial  brick  building,  one  hundred  by  thirty-four  feet,  two  stories,  with  slate  roof,  has  been erected, as a cost of $2,473 84. Our  free  institutions  are  based  upon  the  virtue  and  intelligence  of  the  people.   They  cannot  stand  upon  any other  foundation.    Hence  the  Education  of  our  youth  is  entitled  to  rank  among  the  first  objects  of  legislative attention.    The  plan  of  placing  our  educational  system  under  the  special  agency  of  a  Board  of  Education, appears to be wise, and the operations of the system thus organized seem to have been sufficiently successful to warrant an undisturbed continuance.  The zeal and ability with which the Secretary of the Board has discharged his laborious duties, are honorable to him and worthy of our respect and approbation.   In  ordinary  times  I  should,  in  such  a  communication  as  this  discuss  somewhat  at  length  the  promotion  of Agriculture,  the  commanding  interest of Vermont,  and  the  favorite pursuit of my  life.   But  the peculiar  state of public  affairs  now  induces  me  to  forbear  entering  upon  the  subject.    The  same  reason  causes  the  omission  of several other topics of general interest. The  freemen  of Vermont  quite  generally  united  recently  in  a  political  action  expressive  of  their  conviction that party predilections must,  in  this  hour  of  our  country’s  cause.   We may hail  their  action  as  the harbinger of that  practical  union  of  patriotic men  throughout  the  loyal States, which will  ensure  the  ultimate  triumph  of  our Government in this war. Failing  of  an  honest,  hearty,  united  political  action,  the  people  of  the  free  States  would  fall  ignobly  below the grandeur of the issues now upon them, and prove themselves unequal to the defence and preservation of free institutions.    Succeeding  in  such  action,  they  guarantee  the  success  our  country’s  cause;  and  we  of  this generation  shall  have  the  honor  of  proving  man’s  capacity  for  self  government.    We  shall  prove  that  free institutions,  so  far  from  being  a  failure,  possess  that  inherent moral  power,  and  can  at  all  times  command  that physical and material force, requisite for their stability and perpetuity. The  causes  of  the  war  now  upon  us  are  so  well  understood  by  the  people  of  our  State,  that  it  would  be superfluous  here  to  rehearse  them.    They  also  comprehend  the  magnitude  of  the  issues  involved  in  the  war.  They  see  in  the  struggle  a  contest  for  national  existence  –  for  that  constitutional  liberty  and  its  attendant blessings  bequeathed  to  us  by  the  fathers,  and which we  are  bound  by  every  principle  to  transmit,  unimpaired, to those who come after us.  They are willing to expend their blood and treasure, if need be, to the fullest extent of their means, to aid the National Government in crushing this causeless rebellion. If  this war,  brought  on  by  those who  are  striving  to  introduce  in  this  fair  land  the  reign  of  chaos  and  elder night, where  all  has  heretofore  been  so  bright  and  beneficent,  shall  ultimately  recoil  upon  themselves,  blotting out  the  institution of slavery, of which  they are  the apologists and defenders, such an effect may be accepted as a natural result of their madness and guilt. Senators and Representatives: Life at the present time is to us indeed a sacred and important trust.  Responsibilities of the gravest character fall upon the American citizen in this hour of the Republic’s peril.  Doubtless we are to be sifted and purified by the  trials  through which we are passing,  to be purged  from  the dross engendered by a  long period of peace and prosperity,  to  prize more        fully  the  blessings  of  constitutional  liberty,  and  feel  and  give  expression  to  a  purer and more earnest  love of country, and a more defined and emphatic nationality of view and  sentiment,  than we have  heretofore  experienced.    Let  us,  then,  trusting  in  the God  of  our  fathers,  courageously welcome  the  trials that are to prove of what stuff our manhood is made.  Let us collectively move forward in concord and unity for the  defence  of  our  country,  and  individually  do  our  whole  duty,  as  becomes  citizens  living  under  the  most beneficent Government  the world ever saw.   We are not permitted  to  lift  the veil which conceals  the future, nor can we  fathom  the  deep  designs  of  the Almighty  in  the  events  now  transpiring  in  our  country,  but we will  not doubt that His overruling Providence is with us now, as with our fathers of old, and in these events is  “From seeming evil still educing good.” FREDERICK HOLBROOK.
