Executive  Speech of  Martin Chittenden  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume VI.  1813    SPEECH OF GOV. MARTIN CHITTENDEN – 1813 1 .  Gentlemen  of  the Council,  and Gentlemen  of  the House  of Representatives,  – We meet  under  prospects  not the most flattering.  Our political horizon is encircled with clouds somewhat portentous.  It is a period peculiarly interesting,  as  it  respects  our  national  and  state  affairs,  and  most  eventful  in  the  history  of  the  world:    a  crisis demanding  the  united  wisdom,  prudence,  and  firmness  of  the  whole  community.    Under  these  views  and prospects,  and with  a  due  sense  of my  own  inexperience  and  imperfections,  it  is with  extreme  diffidence  that  I enter upon  the duties  assigned me by  the  constituted  authorities of  a moral  and  enlightened people.   But  I do  it cheerfully, relying on that candor and indulgence which I have often heretofore experienced. The  national  constitution  having wisely  placed  our  foreign  relations  in  the  hands  and  under  the  controul  of the general government, our attention will principally be directed to the local concerns of the State.   To provide for  the  protection  and  promote  the  greatest  possible  prosperity  and  happiness  of  every  class  of  citizens,  being the  legitimate  object  of  all  wise  and  free  governments,  will  necessarily  claim  your  attention.    The  peculiar situation,  under which  I  am  called  to  enter  upon  the  duties  of  the Chief Magistrate, must  afford  an  apology  for not  laying  before  you,  at  this  time,  so  particular  a  view  of  the  affairs  of  the  State  as might  be  desirable.   But  I have  the  satisfaction  of  believing  that  the wisdom  and  intelligence  of  the  legislature,  composed  of men  elected from every portion of the State, and intimately acquainted with the feelings and necessities of their constituents, will furnish all the information necessary to promote the public interest. The  preservation  of  all  free  governments  principally  depending  on  the  virtue  and  intelligence  of  the  great body  of  the  people,  forcibly  recommends  the  propriety  of  selecting  for  office  men  distinguished  for  virtuous example; disregarding those local and 2  party views which stimulate one part of the community to trample on the rights  of  the  other,  and  to  sport  with  the  feelings  and  happiness  of  their  fellow  men.    In  just  retribution, however, for this perversion of reason, this violation of duty, it will generally be found that this spirit is not less destructive to the happiness of the aggressor than of the aggrieved. The  importance  of  the  subject  of  the  militia  will  not  fail  to  claim  your  deliberate  consideration.    I  have always  considered  this  force  peculiarly  adapted  and  exclusively  assigned  for  the  service  and  protection  of  the respective  States;  excepting  in  cases  provided  for  by  the  national  constitution,  viz.  to  execute  the  laws  of  the Union, suppress insurrection, and repel invasions.  It never could have been contemplated by the framers of our excellent constitution, who, it appears, in the most cautious manner, guarded the sovereignty of the States, or by the  States,  who  adopted  it,  that  the  whole  body  of  the  militia  were,  by  any  kind  of  magic  at  once  to  be transformed  into  a  regular  army  for  the  purpose  foreign  conquest;  and  it  is  to  be  regretted,  that  a  construction should  have  been  given  to  the  constitution,  so  peculiarly  burdensome  and  oppressive  to  that  important  class  of our fellow citizens. The  known  spirit  and  patriotism  of  the  militia  forbid  the  supposition  that  they  will  not  cheerfully  perform their  duty,  when  it  shall  be  clearly  defined,  and  their  rights  permanently  secured;  and  nothing  is  now  wanting but  proper  regulations  and  suitable  encouragement  to  render  them  an  efficient  force  for  all  the  purposes contemplated by  the national and state constitutions.   But a  recurrence  to our present militia system will evince the  propriety  of many  alterations  and  amendments.   The  propriety,  likewise,  of many  alterations  in  our  present code of laws may be apparent.  But that subject being under the consideration of the Hon. Council of Censors, I would suggest the propriety of waiting the result of their deliberations. The  state  of  our  financial  concerns will  be  derived  from  the Treasury Department;  and  the  known  integrity and  ability, with which  the  duties  of  that  office  have  been  performed,  leaves  no  room  to  doubt  its  correctness.  And  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  no  additional  burdens  will  be  necessary  to meet  the  current  expences  of  the  present year.    A  consideration  of  the  embarrassed  situation  of  our  commerce  –  the  great  source  of  national  and individual  income  in  times  of  prosperity,  and  the  heavy  burdens  soon  to  be  imposed  in  the  form  of  direct  and internal taxes cannot fail to recommend a strict attention to the principles of economy both public and private.                                                  1 Ms. Council Journal, Vol. 7, p. 19.  2 Or in the printed journal The national constitution very justly enjoins due obedience to all the laws and regulations which are made in conformity  to  it.   But  the  same  charter of our political  rights ensures us  the  freedom of  speech; a  right never  to be  resigned  while  a  single  vestige  of  civil  liberty  remains.    It  is,  therefore,  our  unquestionable  right,  and,  at periods  like  the  present  it may  be  considered our duty, not only  to  reflect on  the  state of our public  affairs, but with a manly and temperate frankness, becoming freemen, to express our sentiments respecting them; and in the exercise of all fair and constitutional means, endeavour  to produce such a state of  things as will promote a  just, secure and honourable peace, and avert the evils we feel, and the much greater, which we have reason to expect, from  a  war  with  one  of  the  most  powerful  actions  of  Europe,  and  from  the  toils  and  intrigues,  still  more dangerous, of  another.   The war,  in which we  are  engaged, would  require  the united wisdom and energy of  the nation  to  sustain.    It was declared under  circumstances which  forcibly  induced  a great proportion of  the people to  consider  it  at  least  doubtful,  as  to  its  necessity,  expedience  or  justice.   And  its  continuance  has  become  still more  so,  since  the  removal  of  the  Orders  in  Council,  the  principal  alleged  cause  of  it.    The  subject  of impressment never having been considered a sufficient cause of war by either of  the preceding administrations, and having been adjusted by two of the present cabinet, Messrs. Monroe and Pinckney, ministers on our part, in such a manner as was by them stated to be both safe and honourable to our country, it would seem that it ought not  now  to  be  considered  an  insuperable  obstacle  to  a  fair  and  honourable  peace,  or  an  adequate  cause  for  a protracted,  expensive  and  destructive  war.    The  conquest  of  the  Canadas,  of  which  so  much  has  been  said,  if desirable  under  any  circumstances,  must  be  considered  a  poor  compensation  for  the  sacrifices,  which  are  and must  necessarily  be  made.    Notwithstanding  the  multiplied  embarrassments,  and  afflictive  judgments,  with which we  are visited, yet  as  a  people, our  situation  is  enviable  compared with  that of many  of  our  fellow men, who are groaning under  the  iron hand of despotism and oppression; and we have  the highest  reason  to express, with  grateful  hearts,  our  dependence  on  an  indulgent  Providence  for  the  bounties  of  the  present  season,  and other unmerited blessings we still enjoy. Should  the  documents  of  the  office  furnish  matter  for  your  consideration,  it  will  be  made  the  subject  of  a future  communication.    In  the  prosecution  of  the  important  business  of  the  session,  you  may  be  assured,  that every measure  calculated  to  promote  the  security,  prosperity,  or  happiness  of  our  constituents,  shall meet with my cordial co-operation and support.  I am sensible, that in times of party heat and general commotion, passion too often usurps  the place of reason; which seldom fails  to  lead  to an improper result.   But, with a firm reliance on  the assistance of Divine Providence,  I  trust we  shall never disregard  those duties, which are enforced by  the national  and  state  constitutions,  and  which,  if  steadily  pursued,  will  not  fail  to  result  in  the  promotion  of  the public good. MARTIN CHITTENDEN.
