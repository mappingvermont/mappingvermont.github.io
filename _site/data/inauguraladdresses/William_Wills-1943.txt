Inaugural address of  William H. Wills  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1943        Thursday, January 7, 1943 Inaugural Message  Members of the General Assembly:  My message  to  you  today,  and  through  you  to  the  people  of  Vermont,  serves  a  dual  purpose:  it  contains  a report of my stewardship during the past two years, and an outline for the future containing suggestions for your consideration. Our  meeting  here  today  is  historic.  This  general  assembly  which  has  convened  is  one  of  the  few  “war legislatures”  in  the  history  of  our  State. We  meet  with  our  Country  at  war  and  with  the  world  aflame.  But  of even  greater  significance  is  the  very  fact  of  our meeting  in  this  democratic way  so  that  the  voice  of  the  people may be heard, through their elected representatives, telling how they wish to be governed. Two years ago  I addressed a General Assembly during  times of peace  for our Country. We met  in  the hope that  war  would  not  involve  us;  we  met  with  the  fear  that  it  would.  All  doubt  however  was  removed  from  our minds  thirteen months ago at  the  time of  the  treacherous attack by  the  Japanese. A call  to arms was  sounded  to us all. Since that time every effort has been towards the achievement of ultimate victory. It  now  becomes  the  duty  of  you  as  the  legislators  for  the  people  of  the  State  of  Vermont  to  provide  the machinery  necessary  for  the  readjustment  that  we  must  make,  whereby  the  functions  of  our  State  government can be geared to the new demands set upon it, both on the fighting and the home fronts. It will become my duty to see that the laws you enact are faithfully executed. The fundamental principle of promoting the common good should be the foundation upon which the relation between us in the executive department and you in the law making branch of government is based. This  is  the  testing  time  for  representative  government.  To  succeed,  we  must  have  faith  in  one  another,  we must respect each other’s view, and, finally, be guided by our common interests in a common cause. The worth of a State is the worth of the individuals comprising it. So, lest our own rights be lost, we must have a determination renewed and strengthened to govern ourselves so well that we shall never be ruled by a tyrant or a despot. We  are  engaged  in  total  war  against  our  enemies.  Total  war  means  that  states  as  well  as  individuals  must temporarily  relinquish  to  the  Federal  government  rights  to  which  they  have  been  accustomed,  and  to  which under our republican system of government, they are the rightful possessors. These  relinquishments  are  and  must  be  temporary.  With  victory,  they  must  be  returned  unimpaired  to  the individuals and to the states. In  the  final analysis,  it  is  for  the conservation of  these very  things which  constitute our  free  society  that we fight today. That for which we fight must not be destroyed in the struggle for its preservation. Many  of  you,  I  know,  are  here  attending  this  session  at  considerable  personal  sacrifice.  You  are  needed  at home.  You  are  needed  in  your  business  and  on  your  farms.  One  of  the  most  critical  shortages  existing  in  our Country  today  is  that of man power.  I believe  I  reflect  the  temper of  the people when  I  tell you  that,  in view of these considerations,  they expect  that  this General Assembly will devote  its entire  time  to essential matters and will leave those of lesser importance until such time as we are not engaged in a war for our very existence. In  line  with  the  foregoing  and  to  help  expedite  the  work  of  the  session,  I  shall  lay  before  you  the  tenth biennial budget together with my budget message early next week. I turn, now, to those elements of your State government primarily concerned with the war and our defense.  Vermont Council of Safety Long  before  December  7,  1941,  the  day  that  Japan  attacked  our  country,  Vermont  had  set  up  a  civilian defense  organization  which  was  functioning  and  in  readiness  to  take  over  all  the  State’s  civilian  protection activities. Due to this foresighted policy no time was lost on that score. Since  then every branch of civilian defense which  the federal, military and civilian authorities have devised for the protection of the civilian population has been perfected and put into operation by your State government through the Vermont Council of Safety.  Tribute is due to all those who have participated in this program. I want you to know, and I want the people of  Vermont  to  know,  that  in  my  humble  opinion  no  group  of  men  and  women,  all  over  the  State,  has  ever endeavored to serve the State with greater interest, efficiency, self-sacrifice, and fidelity, than the workers under the Vermont Council of Safety. It has been and  is a most difficult  task of organization and education. Without  fanfare and without waste of public  funds,  there  has  been  put  into  execution  a  program  which,  I  believe,  can  be  compared  with  any  in operation in our sister states and the one in Vermont will not be found wanting. To  those who  say or  to  those who  think  that  the Civilian Defense activities are “much ado about nothing”  I say,  nothing  could  more  delight  the  enemy  we  fight  than  such  an  attitude.  Our  work  is  not  done.  It  is  the measured opinion of military  analysts  that  as  the  situation becomes  acute  for  the Axis powers  the danger of  air attack  on  the  continental  United  States  increases  rather  than  decreases.  The  reasons  for  such  an  air  attacks  are numerous, but the most important one right now seems to be that it would mean everything for morale building purposes for the German people in their time of need. The unexpected is the realm in which the enemy operates. Let us be ever vigilant. State Guard As  you  all  know,  the  last  session  of  the  legislature  authorized  me  to  organize  and  maintain  such  military forces as  I might deem necessary  to defend  the State during  the absence of  the National Guard which had been inducted into the Federal service. The  sum  of  $35,000 was  appropriated  to  purchase  uniforms  and  equipment  for  the military  organization  to be  formed.  The  first  regiment  of  the  State,  the  Vermont  State  Guard,  consisting  of  12  companies,  was completely  organized  on  May  28,  1941.    Clothing,  uniforms  and  equipment  were  purchased  by  the  State.  A quantity of arms was furnished by the Federal Government Since the organization of the first regiment, 18 additional companies, originally organized as Home Defense and Reserve Companies, have been brought  into  the Vermont State Guard proper, making 30 companies  in all. By  virtue  of  an  allocation  of  funds  the Emergency Board,  these  18  companies were  clothed  in  cotton  uniforms and were otherwise equipped by the State, and they are now in the process of being provided with proper winter clothing by the Federal Government. On  December  10,  1941,  certain  units  of  the  State  Guard  were  called  out  for  duty  at  the  demand  of  the Commanding  General  of  the  First  Service  Command  in  Boston.  Guards  performed  their  duties  for  a  period  of 10 days and one company remained on duty for a month. During the period of active duty there were no serious accidents nor cases of illness. The  total strength of  the State Guard  is now 113 officers and 1,409 enlisted men. Here, again, can be  found men giving  freely of  their  time  for  the common good. The members of  the State Guard are giving up anywhere from  1  to  3  nights  a  week  for  training. Most  of  the  officers  and  many  of  the  non-commissioned  officers  have given  up  a  week  of  their  vacation  period  to  attend  the  Tactical  School  of  the  First  Service  Command  in Massachusetts, where they received proper and modern training in present day methods of defense. I  wish  to  commend  the  officers  and  men  of  the  State  Guard  for  the  efficient  manner  in  which  they  have performed  their  duties,  for  the  high  spirit  they  have  shown  in  training,  and  for  their  readiness  to  meet emergencies as they have arisen. Vermonters  may  well  be  proud  of  their  State  Guard,  and  the  communities  in  which  these  companies  are located should give them all encouragement and aid possible. Emergency Powers War  conditions  and  problems  of  state  in  war  time  have  caused  intricate  questions  of  state  and  federal cooperation  to  arise.  It  is  fortunate  that  in  most  if  not  all  instances  we  of  Vermont  have  been  able  to  comply with  these  requests when made although many  times  it has been almost  impossible  to do  so. Vermont  is one of the  few  states  which  have  not  had  either  a  special  or  regular  session  of  the  legislature  since  the  declaration  of war. Consequently there have not been granted to its governor emergency powers to carry out these activities. Were  it  not  for  the  spirit  of  voluntary  cooperation  which  has  constantly  grown  in  the  cities  and  towns  of Vermont  as  each  day  brought  us  greater  realization  of  our  danger,  and  brought  continually  increasing emergency  requests  for  cooperative  action  on  the  part  of  the  State  and  departments,  it  would  have  been necessary  to  call  for many  special  sessions  to  ask  for  specific  legislative  authority  to  cope with  these problems as  they  have  arisen.  Even  so,  there  have  been  instances  where  we  have  been  unable  fully  and  completely  to meet the requests made of us. It  now  appears  that  as  the  war  continues  and  as  extraordinary  demands  are  made  upon  the  State  for affirmative action in fields involving  the common defense, compliance with  the demands within  the framework of our statutes will be totally inadequate since existing law could prevent and forbid such requested action. I  recommend  that  this  legislature  clothe  the  chief  executive,  therefore,  with  emergency  powers;  such powers,  incidentally,  as  have  been  conferred  upon  the  chief  executives  of  many  of  our  sister  states  and  which have permitted them immediately to meet extraordinary situations as they have arisen. A  bill  has  been  prepared,  of  which  copies  have  been,  sent  you,  to  accomplish  this  end  Vermont  both  in relation  to  the governor’s authority and  that of  the Council of Safety.  In suggesting  its enactment  I  realize  fully that only the bitter fact of war could justify any governor in asking for such authority. I promise you that I shall administer  it with  the degree of  conservatism  commensurate with  the great  trust which  the power  imposes,  and to relinquish such emergency powers the moment victory is achieved. You  will  note  that  the  bill  makes  no  provision  for  an  appropriation,  Application  would  made  to  the Emergency  Board,  your  agency,  should  occasion  arise  requiring  finds  with  which  meet  an  existing  situation, Thus the legislative body’s “power of the purse” is in no wise infringed. Highways Our highway program and aid to the towns for highway work in Vermont is financed almost entirely by use of funds made available from license and registration fees and the revenue derived from the State gasoline tax. In December, 1941, it became apparent to me that there probably would be a reduction in these revenues on account of  the changes brought about by  the war effort, which would  result  in a deficit  in  the highway  funds at the end of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1943, if all the appropriations for highways were expended. Therefore, I asked  the State Highway Board  in December, 1941, not  to  let any more construction contracts on  its highway program. That request was complied with. In April of 1942  it  appeared quite  certain  that highway  revenues would be  further  reduced,  and on  the 13th of  that  month  I  addressed  a  communication  to  all  highway  officials  and  other  interested  parties,  through  the public  press,  concerning  the  effect  of  various  war  demands  upon  the  Vermont  highway  program.  I  asked  the towns  voluntarily  to withhold  applications  for  highway  funds  until  after  July  first,  at which  time more  reliable information was expected to be available. I  asked  the  Motor  Vehicle  Department  to  prepare  and  submit  to  me  as  soon  as  possible  after  July  first  a statement of  estimated  revenues of  the  fiscal year ending  June  30,  1943.  I  also  asked  the Highway Department for  a  statement  showing  expenditures  to  cover  commitments  and  appropriations  to  be  made  out  of  highway funds for that year.  A  careful  study  was  made  by  the  Motor  Vehicle  Department  in  an  endeavor  to  arrive  at  a  reasonable estimate  of  funds  which  would  be  collected  by  that  Department  and  which  would  be  available  for  highway purposes.  Their  study  indicated  an  estimated  revenue  of  some  $3,000,000  for  the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30, 1943, as compared with $5,568,229 which was the sum realized for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1942. These estimates  clearly  indicated  that  if  no  action  were  taken  we  would  end  the  year  with  a  deficit  of  around  two million dollars. Believing  that  all  highways  should  be maintained,  if  possible,  through  this  emergency  as  they  are  essential to  the war  effort  and  our  civilian  economy,  I  asked  the Highway Board  to  obtain  a  revised  estimate of  revenue for  the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30  1943.  Their  estimate  showed  that  the  expected  revenue  together  with  the $600,000  unexpended  funds  —  due  to  the  suspension  of  the  State  Highway  construction  program  —  would provide  sufficient  funds  to  carry  on  the  essential  highway  maintenance,  provided  all  construction  work  by  the State and towns were discontinued. Not  wishing  to  have  to  bring  to  you  at  this  time  a  statement  showing  an  anticipated  deficit  of  nearly  two million dollars in highway finances in this fiscal year, and believing that it was possible for the State to proceed with a reduced program on a pay-as-you-go basis, I placed this information before the Board of Allotment. With this  information  this Board  (authorized by Section 3 of  the Acts of 1939) allocated  funds  for maintenance  from appropriations made by the 1941 Legislature in the sum of $2,245,000 covering maintenance as follows: $ 50,000.00 State Aid Bridges ............................................................................................................. 5,000.00 Forest and Park Roads ..................................................................................................... Maintenance of State Aid Roads...................................................................................... 450,000.00 Maintenance of State Roads and Bridges (plus assessments from towns under  section 4702 P. L. as amended) .................................................................................  1,100,000.00 140,000.00  Supervision, Engineering and Office Expenses .............................................................. Town Highways ............................................................................................................... 500,000.00 This total allocation is approximately $2,000,000 less than appropriations. On  July  15th  I  addressed  a  letter  to  all  town  selectmen,  municipal  officials  and  members  of  the  1941 Legislature and asked for their cooperation in a reduced highway program. The response to this communication was  most  gratifying,  the  sentiment  being  that  the  State  should  not  go  into  debt  in  order  to  carry  on  highway construction  on  the  state  system  or  in  the  towns. The State Highway Department has  cooperated by making  all possible savings, and the number of employees has been reduced by 97 persons. I  recommend  that  the  Appropriation  Act  for  the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  1943,  be  amended  by  this Legislature in accordance with the amounts allotted by the Board of Allotment so that there will be no deficit in the Highway fund June 30, 1943. The details of  the highway program  including estimated revenue and suggested appropriations for 1944 and 1945 will come to you in the budget and explanations in the budget message.  University of Vermont and State Agricultural College At  the  last  regular  Legislative  Session  an  act was  passed  directing me  to make  a  complete  investigation  of the  affairs  of  the  University  of  Vermont  and  State  Agricultural  College  and  to  report  to  the  next  session.  This investigation  was  carried  on  with  all  possible  expedition.  My  investigation  was  completed  and  on  June  9th, 1941,  the  reports  of  the  experts  were  released  to  the  Press  for  the  information  of  the  people  generally. Thereupon  I  appointed  a Public Advisory Committee which proceeded  to  consider  the University  situation  and make plans  for  its  financial  rehabilitation.  In accordance with  the  recommendations of  this Committee,  I called a Special Legislative Session and in September, 1941 presented to it the plan recommended by that Committee. The  plan  finally  adopted  in  the  Special  Session,  No.  3  of  the  Acts  of  that  Session,  provided  for  financial assistance  to  the University  $520,000. Of  this  amount,  $260,000 was  appropriated  for  immediate  payment  and an additional $260,000 was conditionally appropriated for payment after July 1, 1942, to match gifts to be made in  an  equal  amount  by  alumni  and  friends  of  the  University.  The  entire  appropriation  of  the  State  was  further conditioned upon an agreement by  the University  to use none of  the money so appropriated except for payment of  operating  expenses  above  operating  income  and  $68,880  required  under  the  Legislative  Act  of  the  Special Session  to be used  for  the payment of  interest, annuity payments on contracts outstanding September 16, 1941, and pro rata payment of principal of notes outstanding September 16, 1941, or renewals of such notes. The  initial  payment  under  this  legislation,  $260,000,  was  made  to  the  University  on  September  22,  1941. The  alumni  and  friends  of  the  University,  as  evidenced  by  certification  delivered  to  the  State  Auditor  and which,  he  assures  me,  has  his  approval,  have  contributed  an  amount  in  excess  of  $260,000  to  June  30,  1942. This  contribution  was  made  in  form  to  satisfy  the  State  Auditor  for  all  the  requirements  and  conditions  of  the legislative appropriations as it concerns the second $260,000. Since  the  Special  Session  and  under  the  present  management,  the  operating  budget  of  the  University  and State  Agricultural  College  in  the  current  year  has  been  reduced  between  $100,000  and  $125,000  below  the general  budget  of  1940-41.  It  now  appears  that  the  University  will  have  an  excess  of  income  from  all  sources over  expenses  of  approximately  $100,000  at  the  end  of  the  year  June  30,  1943.  Thus  only  $160,000  of  the current appropriation of $260,000 voted at  the Special Session will be used and $100,000 will be  saved  for use by the University in the coming biennium. The present favorable situation has resulted in part from the following important factors: 1. The reductions in staff made possible by enlistment, Selective Service and employment in war industry. 2. The consolidation of administrative positions. 3. A better than expected retention of students. 4. Income for services to units in connection with the war effort.  5. No unusual cause for repairs. 6. Rigid control of all expenditures. For the coming biennium, it is expected that the discrepancy between income and expenses will be $150,000 each year as follows: $10,500  loss per pupil .............................  $160.00 1.  College of Agriculture .................  approx. 77.00 59.500  loss per pupil ............................. 2.  College of Arts and Education .....  approx. 7,500  loss per pupil ............................. 53.00 3.  College of Engineering ................  approx. 72.500  loss per pupil .............................  133.00 4.  College of Medicine ....................  approx. ---------------   $150,000 Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  the  University  of  Vermont  and  State  Agricultural  College  will  request  an appropriation of $50,000 for 1944 (which, in addition to the $100,000 referred to above, will make available for that  fiscal  year  a  total  of  $150,000)  and  an  appropriation  of  $150,000  for  1945  or  $200,000  for  this  biennium and I recommend the appropriation of this amount to be expended subject to the conditions set forth in section 3 of No. 3 of the acts, Special Session of 1941, approved September 16, 1941. This,  of  course,  is  in  addition  to  the  regular  appropriations,  which  have  been  made  for  many  years,  for special services. These latter appropriations are provided for in the regular budget. Details  of  the  operation  of  the  institution  for  the  current  year  will  be  furnished  you,  together  with  the auditor’s report as required by law. As  regards  the  organization,  Dr.  John  S.  Millis  has  filled  the  office  of  President  since  his  election  in November  1,  1941.  He  took  the  helm  at  a  most  critical  period  and  at  a  time  when  grave  doubts  existed  as  to whether  or  not  the  alumni  had  the  ability  or  even  the  courage  and  faith  to  rally  to  the  assistance  of  the University  with  financial  support  sufficient  to  make  operative  the  plan  of  rehabilitation.  All  those  who  have followed  closely  the  affairs  of  the  University  appreciate  that  he  is  rebuilding  the  institution  on  firmer,  more enduring and also more efficient lines. The  progress  made  in  rehabilitating  this  age  old  institution  for  youth  is  the  direct  result  of  the  untiring efforts  of  the  President,  the  Trustees,  the  Administrative  and  teaching  staff  and  of  the  loyal  support  of  the alumni body and the people of the state through their legislative representatives. Agriculture In  normal  times  agriculture  is  the  foundation  of  the  State’s  economic  welfare.  Under  present  wartime emergency conditions, when production of food must be maintained at all hazards, its importance in the general war  effort  cannot be over  estimated. Our  armed  forces, our  industrial workers, our military  allies overseas,  and the  civilian  population  at  home  all  must  be  provided  with  a  generous  supply  of  nourishing  food.  Ultimate victory  depends  just  as  much  upon  this  factor  as  upon  the  production  of  armament.  To  this  end  every encouragement  should  be  given,  and  every  possible  effort  should  be made  to  facilitate,  food  production  and  to remove the handicaps which have hampered our farmers during the past year. Vermont  agriculture  must  maintain  and  if  possible  increase  its  production  of  fluid  milk  and  other  dairy products. Owing  to  increased  cost  of  operation  brought  on  by  the  acute  shortage  and  high  prices  of  farm  labor too many  farmers have already been  forced out of business;  too many dairy animals have already been sold  for slaughter.  Farmers  have  found  it  impossible  to  produce milk  under wartime  conditions  and  sell  it  at  peacetime prices. Agriculture  cannot  be  expected  to  carry  on  in  this  inequitable manner.  It  is my  intent  to  continue  those efforts  designed  to  arrest  the  decrease  in  milk  production  now  taking  place,  and  properly  to  compensate Vermont dairymen for their long hours of arduous labor. The  threatened  acute  shortage  of  meat,  moreover,  adds  a  new  incentive  for  encouragement  of  the  poultry and  egg  producing  industry.  It  is  obvious,  too,  that  the  production  of  such  food  crops  as  potatoes  and  apples takes  on  enhanced  importance  under  present  conditions.  Measures  to  protect  and  improve  such  crops  and toward better grading and handling in the process of marketing them thus becomes increasingly important.  Bang’s Disease The present  law  relative  to Bang’s disease  appears  to be  functioning  satisfactorily.  It  is based on  control of this disease by test and calf vaccination and there is now little doubt that this method provides the most efficient means of control known  to veterinary science. Reacting cattle may be  retained upon  the  farm and are gradually replaced by young cattle  rendered  immune  to  infection. The program  is practicable because production of milk and  breeding  programs  are  not  interrupted;  it  is  economical  because  only  nominal  sums  are  required  for indemnities.  The  ultimate  expense  to  be  borne  by  the  State  will  be  relatively  insignificant  compared  with  the huge  appropriations  expended  for  indemnities  in  the  program  for  the  eradication  of  bovine  tuberculosis. Dairy being  Vermont’s  leading  agricultural  pursuit,  it  seems  logical  that  this  program  is  deserving  of  appropriations sufficient  to  supply  the  demand  from  cattle  owners  and  at  the  same  time  to  prosecute  the  work  to  successful completion. Budget figures will show a recommended increase under this heading. Farm Labor As  farmers  enter  a  new  year  they  are  being  asked  by  their  Federal Government  to  produce  probably  about two percent more milk, and  fifteen  to  twenty percent more poultry products  than a year ago. To do  this  job and do it well, Vermont farmers must have the necessary labor that is needed for such a job. They  need  two  kinds  of  labor.  First,  regular  year-round  labor,  and  secondly,  seasonal  labor.  Recent  action by  the War Manpower  Commission  and  the  Selective  Service  System, whereby  essential workers will  be  kept on  farms  and  in  some  cases  new  year-round  workers  will  be made  available  for  farmers,  will  be  of  great  help meeting the regular farm worker’s problem. However, we should always be on the alert for new sources of such help. As to seasonal farm workers, methods must be devised whereby we can assure Vermont farmers of a supply of such help to assist them in sugaring, spring’s work, haying, silo filling, apple picking and other seasonal jobs, or production will be pretty apt to fall below the demands that are being placed on Vermont farmers. It  seems  to me  that  farmers of Vermont  are now being  asked  to do more with  less. They  are being  asked  to produce  the  most  products  they  have  ever  produced,  with  probably  the  smallest  force  of  farm  workers,  the smallest amount of materials, and the smallest amount of services they have ever had. I  have  felt  and  now  feel  that  the  State  of  Vermont  should  take  an  active  part  in  helping  farmers  in  this endeavor, especially in helping them to secure as much labor as possible. You are undoubtedly  familiar with  the work of  the special Farm Labor Committee named by me during  the summer just past. This committee was created to study and to point the way whereby necessary farm help could be secured for Vermont farmers, and to coordinate the many diverse attempts being made to meet this problem. The  Committee,  after  thorough  study,  has  recently  proposed  a  plan  for  getting  such  seasonal  workers  onto farms.  This  plan  calls  for  the  use  of  Vermont  high  school  students  and  Volunteer  Land  Corps  boys  and  girls. This  type  of  help  will  not  be  as  good  as  the  workers  that  have  been  available  for  such  work  in  the  past. However,  these  workers  are  now  employed  in  full-time  jobs  in  war  industries  or  they  are  in  the  armed  forces. Some  substitute will  have  to  be  used  for  them  and Vermont  and Eastern  city  youth  seemed  like  the  best  to  the committee. This Governor’s Farm Labor Committee stated in their report, a copy of which will be placed on your desks, that  $25,000  would  be  needed  yearly  in  1943  and  1944  to  carry  out  such  a  program.  I  recommend  that  this amount be made available for this purpose. Industry Vermont  industry  has  been  called  upon  and  has  responded  by  playing  a  vital  part  in  our  Country’s  war effort.  The  industrial  production  volume  for  1942  alone  is  estimated  substantially  to  exceed  Two  Hundred Million dollars. It  was  to  increase  Vermont’s  potential  industrial  capacity  that  I  recommended  that  the  last  Legislature establish the office of Industrial Agent. Such an office was set up by them and the agent’s report to the General Assembly outlines the effective work which has been accomplished as a result. You will note that during the ten months  of  actual  operation  eighteen  new  industries  were  established  in  the  state.  These,  on  November  first, employed 1,311 persons with an estimated annual payroll of $1,503,093. While  it  is  difficult  to  figure  the  dollar  volume  of war  and  civilian  business  procured  for Vermont  through work started by  the Industrial Agent or  through contacts and help  that office furnished, we know  it will amount to several millions of dollars. It  was  only  after  long  consideration  that  I  took  the  step  of  suspending  active  operation  of  the  Industrial Agent’s office and  released  the Agent  to War Production Board  to head  its Vermont office. However,  it was so important  that  all  industrial  efforts  be  consolidated  during  the  war  crisis  that  I  decided  last  January  it  was  the best  thing  to  do.  Through  cooperative  action  by  the  WPB  and  the  executive  office,  the  State’s  industrial interests have been well taken care of in the past year. It appears inevitable that the era after the war will bring even greater industrial problems than now exist. We must be prepared to meet these problems. One way to do this is to appropriate necessary funds so that the active work  of  the  Industrial Agent’s  office may  be  resumed whenever  it  is  determined  necessary. This  I  recommend that you do. The budget has been so arranged. Labor and Unemployment Compensation The  most  fortunate  community  is  to  be  found  where  management  and  labor  are  not  only  enlightened  but appreciative of the other’s position and problems. Experience in Vermont would indicate that here we have such a community. I can report to you that both have been particularly cooperative when I have had occasion to intervene in the few differences of opinion that have existed. Again I say, we are, indeed, fortunate. Today  in  Vermont  both  labor  and  management  are  striving  toward  one  common  objective—  winning  the war. This is as it should be. The  Department  of  Industrial  Relations  and  the  Unemployment  Compensation  Commission  are  state departments  having  much  to  do  with  the  problems  of  the  laboring  man  in  Vermont.  They  have  maintained friendly relationships with both employers and workers and have received fine cooperation from both groups. The  unemployment  trust  fund,  a  reserve made  from  prescribed  payments  by  the  employers,  presently  is  in excess  of  $6,000,000;  it  will  undoubtedly  exceed  $7,000,000  before  the  end  of  1943.  As  you  are  aware,  this fund  is  in  the  nature  of  “wage  insurance.”  It  is  inevitable  that  the  post  war  period  will  see  an  upheaval  in employment,  and  this  will  mean  a  tremendous  withdrawal  from  the  fund;  it  is  conceivable  that  even,  the relatively large amount now on hand could be halved in one year of severe business depression.  These are not ordinary times, I repeat, and we must proceed with deliberation. However, I believe that some liberalization of benefit payments is advisable.  The  Compensation  commission  informs  me  that  providing  the  present  level  of  benefits  is  maintained  it would  be  feasible  to  lengthen  the  duration  of  payments  without  impairing  the  solvency  of  the  fund.  I recommend that this be done. State Aid for Education The  State  Board  of  Education  deserves  the  appreciation  of  the  people  of  the  State  of  Vermont  for  the wartime  adjustments  in  education  being  carried  out  by  the  Department  of  Education  and  the  local  schools. Vermont  has  been  among  those  states which  immediately  put  into  operation  an  aggressive;  farsighted wartime program in education without sacrificing the generally accepted practices in this. Our  schools  have  performed  an  impressive  variety  of  wartime  services,  which  include  adoption  of  an accelerated  normal  school  program,  administration  of  adjustments  to  provide  the  best  teachers  available, cooperation  with  war  agencies  in  civilian  defense  activities,  rationing,  transportation,  evacuation,  sale  of  war bonds  and  stamps,  the  “School  at  War”  program,  salvage,  the  Liberty  Ship  Naming  Contest,  civilian cooperation,  consumer  education,  rehabilitation,  training  of  war  production  workers,  the  High  School  Victory Corps,  the youth-farm  labor program,  the model  aircraft project,  aeronautics,  radio, Victory Gardens, nutrition,  school lunches, ‘‘Share-the-Meat” program, and child care. Education in Vermont is on the offensive. While our schools are engaged in an all-out program for victory, I know that our educational leaders are looking into the future. They hope to so prepare our present generation of pupils  that  the  latter  can  carry  the  complex  burdens of  a post-war world  in  such  a way  that  the principles upon which our firm of government and way of life are founded will be preserved and perpetuated. State Aid for Education Rural boys and girls of Vermont are entitled  to school opportunities equal  to  those furnished  the children of larger  communities.  To  provide  for  the  future  welfare  of  the  State,  more  of  these  opportunities  should  be extended to them.  If  rural  communities  are  to  retain  their  teachers,  and  it  an  adequate  number  of  desirable  young  men  and women are  to continue  to be encouraged  to prepare  for rural school  teaching,  rural salaries must be  raised. Yet, many towns are unable to do without additional State aid. The  equated  pupil  State  aid  allowance  under  No.  92  of  the  Acts  of  1935  of  $15.00  can  and  should  be increased to $16.50. This can be accomplished with no increase in the budgetary total over the budget total figures of 1941. This plan will come to you in the budget message. . The total amount of appropriations recommended for the Department of Education for this biennium has not been increased over the present biennium. I further recommend that Section 4338 of the Public Laws be so amended that, there may be counted toward the  aid  to  the  rural  school  district  the  average  daily  attendance  of  those whose  excuse  is  approved  by  the  State Board  of Education  so  that  school  boys  and  girls  during  the  emergency may be  allowed  to  assist  in  the victory farm labor program and that neither the school nor the child be penalized. Public Welfare and Institutions One  of  the  outstanding  pieces  of  legislation  passed  by  your  predecessors  of  the  1941  Legislature  was  the joint  resolution  creating  the  Commission  to  study  existing  laws  of  Vermont  relating  to  children  and  child welfare services, the family and the home, and to report to this session of the Legislature with recommendations as to suggested revisions and additional legislation they believe is needed. This  commission was  appointed  promptly,  has made  a  thorough  study  of  the  social  laws,  and  has made  an exhaustive report which will be in your hands shortly.  It  will  be  a  grave mistake  if  the members  of  this  body  fail  to  use  this  report  as  their  guide  for  a  long-term program in this legislative field  The Board for Control of Mental Defectives, established last session, represents another progressive step by virtue of  the  fact  it has  brought  into  a working  relationship  three State department  leads vitally  concerned with this  highly  important  field  of  work —  the  Department  of  Public  Welfare,  the  State  Department  of  Education, and the State Board of Health. The results already accomplished demonstrates the worth of this action.  I  expect  that  proposed  legislation will  be  presented  to  you  for  your  consideration  dealing with  a  placement system in homes under proper supervision from the Brandon State School. Because of the crowded condition at this institution, many of those who should have custodial care are currently denied its benefits. Enlargement  of  quarters  at  this  institution  is  out  of  the  question  for  the  duration  of  the  War,  at  least,  and some  such  care  of  our  mental  defectives  must  be  worked  out.  I  can  assure  you  this  subject  of  our  mental defectives must  be met  not  only  from  an  humanitarian  standpoint  but  from  a  plain  sense  of  duty  on  the  part  of the  State  looking  to  the  future  of  Vermont.  These  unfortunate  children  are  not  only  a  social  problem  but  an economic problem as well, and it is vital that we face this fact now. The  care  of  our  unfortunates  through  the  Welfare  Department  and  our  institutions  should  be  of  primary concern to us all and must have our support. I  have  recommended  increased  appropriations  in  the  biennial  budget  for  the work  of  this  department  and  I trust they will have your support. Old Age Assistance The increased cost of fuel, food, rents and services has presented a serious problem for those on small fixed incomes and allowance. It has been particularly hard on our elderly people dependent in whole or in part on Old Age  Assistance.  The  fact  that  the  Old  Age  Assistance  Department  now  pays  a  relatively  small  monthly  grant presents special problems at this time. It  seems  socially  unjust  to  deprive  an  applicant  on  the waiting  list  of  assistance  to which  he  is  entitled  and for  which  he  is  as  eligible  as  those  now  receiving  assistance.  Moreover,  it  is  not  a  good  financial  policy  to require  a  town  or  city  to  assume  the  support  of  an  aged  individual, who  is  both  eligible  for  and  entitled  to  old age assistance from the State and Federal Government. With this and the increased cost of living in mind, I have recommended an increased appropriation for Old Age Assistance. Works Projects Administration As  you  are  aware,  the Work  Projects  Administration  will  discontinue  assistance  to  other  Federal  agencies and  to  state  and  local governments  in Vermont on February 1st, 1943.  Just before  I  left my office,  I  received  a communication from Harry W. Watling, State Supervisor of the Surplus Marketing Administration  to  the effect that Community  School  Lunch  and Child Day Care Center  Programs will  be  continued,  as  far  as materials  are concerned. I  mention  this  since  many  of  the  projects  such  as  School  Lunches,  Commodity  Distribution,  Citizenship Education  classes,  Sewing  Projects,  Homemaking  Projects,  Free  Library,  and  others,  have  received  State financial assistance through the appropriation for work relief. Some of  these projects may be deemed  so essential  that  the State  should assume  full  responsibility  for  their continuance.  I  suggest  that  this matter  be  referred  to  a  committee  of  this General Assembly  for  thorough  study and recommendation to this Session of the Legislature before February 1 so that appropriate action can be taken on any of them which are deemed essential to the welfare of the State. Anticipating  my  recommendation  in  this  connection,  I  have  had  a  preliminary  survey  made  and  the  data compiled is available for your use. State Employees Here  your  State  government  has  been  confronted  with  a  most  difficult  problem,  in  view  of  the disproportionately  higher  salaries  offered  by  the Federal Government,  by  private  industry,  and with  119  of  our employees  leaving  our  ranks  for  war  service  up  to  this  time.  In  one  institution  alone  there  has  been  an  80 percent employee turnover this last year. The  last  legislative  session  directed  the Governor  to  establish  a  plan  of  classification  and  compensation  for each  position  and  type  of  employment  within  the  State  government  with  certain  exceptions,  and  to  prescribe rules and regulations relating to their employment. An  office  of  personnel  administration  was  set  up  within  the  Executive  Department  and  the  foregoing  has been accomplished. In  addition  to  this,  legislative  direction  has  been  followed  by  the Emergency Board  respecting  a  retirement system.  This  matter  has  been  and  is  being  further  explored  so  that  within  this  biennium,  it  is  my  hope,  a retirement  system  will  be  in  operation  throughout  the  State  government.  Thus,  the  loyal  service  that  has  been and is being daily rendered by Vermont’s State employees will be recognized and a sense of security, otherwise lacking, will be given them. Aviation During  the  present  biennium,  through  the  operation  of  the  Aeronautics  Board  in  allocating  State  funds  for assistance  to  cities  and  towns  in  the  purchase,  of  land  for  airport  purposes,  two  new  airports  have  been established and four of the old ports and fields have been increased in size. This  is  encouraging  progress,  and  yet most  of  the  expenditure  has  gone  towards  the  establishment  of  large airports.  Too  little  progress  has  been  made  in  the  establishment  of  the  smaller  fields,  which  surely  will  be needed  after  the  war  is  finished.  It  is  my  hope  that  communities  in  this  state  will  take  advantage  of  State assistance that is now available for purchase of land suitable for airports, even if they do not have means at hand to develop these fields at the present time. The  last  Legislature  appropriated  $65,000  to  assist  in  developing  aviation  in  the  State,  of  which  there remains approximately $37,000. I recommend that this unexpended balance be reappropriated for the biennium. The  development  of  aviation within  the State will  become  increasingly  important  as  time  passes  due  to  the tremendous advances being made in this field under the stress of war. Soldiers’ Voting Laws Our primary and election  laws  in  force and effect at  the present  time do not afford an opportunity  for all of our  voters  in  the  armed  forces  to  vote  by  absent  voter  ballots,  particularly  those  stationed  at  places  outside  of Continental United States, and  those within  the  limits of Continental United States who may be participating  in military exercises or maneuvers or who are  subject  to military orders which might prevent  them  receiving  their ballots in time to be returned to their local polling places. All of these voters should have an opportunity to vote, and  I  strongly  recommend  that  the committees on  suffrage and elections make a careful study of  these  laws  for the  purpose  of  recommending  the  enactment  of  necessary  amendments  to  our  primary  and  election  laws  to provide an opportunity for all of our legal voters in the armed forces to vote. Conservation and Development Publicity In  normal  times  Vermont  has  made  a  place  for  itself  in  the  list  of  states  for  recreation.  This  last  year,  of course,  that  business  has  fallen  off  due  to  travel  restrictions  and  conditions  caused  by  the  war.  However,  we should not let the name Vermont be lost sight of as a recreational center by stopping our publicity entirely. We  should  put  out  publicity  on  a  war  basis.  We  must  keep  Vermont  in  the  minds  of  the  people,  looking forward to a time when any records we have made in the past will be far excelled. A plan of modified publicity now is necessary for after-the-war benefits. Fish and Game The  Fish  and  Game  Service  is  taking  advantage  of  war  conditions  by  conducting  a  farsighted  program  of educating  the  youth  of  the  State  in  sound  conservation  practices.  This  program  is  bound  to  pay  excellent dividends in the years to come. Vermont recreational business is one that will revive after the end of the war and our fish and game are vital in this connection. It, therefore, appears to be prudent to continue the propagation program now being followed. Despite  serious  handicaps  of  personnel  and  fish  food  the  program  is  as  comprehensive  as  possible  consistent with conditions. Forestry The  timber  resources  of  our  nation  are  being  drawn  on  at  a  higher  rate  than  ever  before  in  our  history. Immense quantities of  timber are needed both  in  the supply  lines, and  for  the use of our armed  force, and  those of  our  allies.  On  the  civilian  front  also,  consumption  of  timber,  in  the  form  of  wood  and  wood  products increases, despite the fact that construction for civilian use has been drastically curtailed. More  and  more,  wood  is  being  substituted  in  civilian  and  military  goods  for  the  metals  that  have  been allocated to war production. Scarcity of oil has increased the demand for wood fuel, and we may expect an even greater demand next year. More of our  forests must be cut and made  into pulp  to  replace Scandinavian or other European pulp we cannot now obtain. The impact of this increased demand for wood and timber is being felt as solidly in Vermont as in any other timber growing state. Due  to  our  efficient  organization  for  detecting  and  fighting  forest  fires,  all  fires  in  recent  years  have  been held to relatively small areas and to slight damage. But, with the increased cutting in our woods and forests with the mountain piles of slash and their wide distribution our forest fire hazard is on the increase.  The  great  value  of  our  timber  crop  has  been  alluded  to, but  our  forests  and wood  lots  furnish  us with  other values, which, if they were measurable in dollars, might easily exceed, year by year, the dollars received for the trees. With this in mind, I recommend to this Legislature that its appropriate committee give careful study to all forestry problems  including  taxation,  and propose  such  changes or  additions  to our  laws  as  in  their opinion  are needed  to  provide  prudent  management,  and  wise  use  of  our  timber  resources,  and  to  assure  that  the  benefits accruing from the existence of forests will not be denied future generations of Vermonters. State Office Building The  last General Assembly,  realizing  the urgent need  for  additional  facilities  for  the  efficient  transaction of the State’s business, and  subscribing  to  the  reasons outlined  to  them  in my  last message, made provisions  for a new  State  Office  Building.  Pursuant  to  this  action,  a  commission  was  established,  an  architect  retained,  plans drawn  and  land  acquired  only  to  have  the  war  intervene  so  that  this  project  could  not  be  completed  under conditions which have existed. Of  the  $600,000  set  aside  for  a  State  Office  Building,  approximately  $47,000  has  been  spent  for  the acquisition  of  the  Howland  and  Smilie  properties  and  the  reimbursement  of  the  architect  for  his  fees.  The Howland House,  incidentally,  is  occupied by  several State  agencies  so  that  full  advantage  is being  taken of  the space it affords. The  pressing  need  for  this  building  still  exists. The  location  is  now  owned  by  the  State. The  detailed  plans are ready to be followed. So that this need may eventually be filled, as well as having a ready made project with which  to  take  up  in  part  the  slack  caused  by  unemployment  hound  to  follow  in  the  after-the-war  period,  I recommend that the balance of this fund be made available as of June 30, 1943, for the next biennium. Gasoline Tax Vermont  is  implementing  the war  effort  in many ways. Not  the  least of  these  is  to be  found  in  the  facilities offered for large scale pilot training programs such as the one now in operation at the Burlington Airport where student officers from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps receive their training. In this connection and so that we may continue to receive the benefits which flow from this ever-expanding, large-scale undertaking,  I  recommend  that you  amend  existing  statutes  relating  to  the State gasoline  tax  so  that it  will  not  apply  to  those  used  by  those  pilot  training  programs  sponsored  by  the  government  of  the  United States. Unappropriated Surplus Governments with an unappropriated  surplus  in  the General Fund are  in a vulnerable position. This State  is in that position today. We have an unappropriated surplus in our General Fund as of June 30, 1942, of $1,463,066 — the largest in our history. Of  the  total  surplus  there  is  $150,000  invested  in  Missisquoi  Bridge  bonds  maturing  in  1961  which  is,  of course,  not  available  at  this  time.  Deducting  this  amount  from  the  unappropriated  surplus  leaves  the  sum  of $1,313,066, which is available for appropriation. It is no disgrace for a state to find itself in this position. There is, however, in times such as we are in, a very grave responsibility for those who are with it. You and I  must  prepare  for  the  declining  resources  which  may  and  probably  will  come  in  the  later  phases  of  the  war. There  is also  that same phase  to watch  in  the post war period, and  this surplus should provide a cushion  to help meet these situations. Therefore,  I  recommend  that  you  appropriate  $1,000,000  of  this  surplus  to  apply  on  the  payment  of  our liability to the enlisted or inducted men and women in the service of our country. Our  promise  to  them,  under  No.  179  of  the  Acts  of  1941,  upon  their  honorable  discharge  will  amount  to approximately $3,000,000. This, of course, will vary according  to  the  length of  the war and  total number  in  the service because  each  such person  is entitled  to $10.00 per month when honorably discharged but not  to  exceed $120.00 overall. This action on your part will save borrowing a like amount when these payments are due. From this surplus the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College will ask for an appropriation for the period 1944 – 45 of $200,000. I also recommend from the unappropriated surplus for the operation of the Farm Labor Committee the sum, of $25,000 each fiscal year of the biennium. Our Soldiers I want to pay tribute on behalf of all our people to the men and women from this State in the armed forces of our Country. In  February  1941,  the  first  contingent,  which  was  the  Vermont  National  Guard,  left  the  State  to  be  in readiness  to  defend  our  country  if  attacked,  and  since  then  many  more  have  been  inducted  through  Selective Service  or  by  enlistment. Thousands  of  these men  are  now  fighting  in  the  four  corners  of  the  earth — many  of them have been called upon  to make  the supreme sacrifice  in  their Country’s service. We are proud of  them all and their contribution to the great cause for which we are all fighting. These  men  are  your  sons  and  your  neighbor’s  sons —  boys  from  your  home  communities,  and  they  seem pretty close to us all. I  would  like  to  suggest  at  this  point  that  we  stand  for  a  moment  in  silent  prayer  for  those  boys  who  have given their lives for us and for the safety and welfare of those on the fighting front. Closing Message Repledging our loyalty to our Country, to the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief of our armed  and  naval  forces;  always  seeking  Divine  guidance  in  our  undertakings,  we  reaffirm  our  loyalty  to  our soldiers  and  sailors  who  fight  and  die  for  us,  to  the  united  spirit  of  Americans  everywhere  —  forgetting  all personal and political differences that in other times divide our people. So  this historic war session of our  last  legislature  let us  face  the  future with courage, strong  in  the  faith  that right will win  this world  struggle  for  freedom  for  all  people  and  that  the  processes  of  democracy  of which we are here a vital part, will prove under fire that governments of free people will survive. The Governor having concluded  the  reading of his message, was escorted  to  the Executive Chamber by  the committee appointed by the Chair. The Supreme Court was escorted from the hall by the Sergeant at Arms. The Joint Assembly dissolved. Rawson C. Myrick Secretary of State, Clerk  .
