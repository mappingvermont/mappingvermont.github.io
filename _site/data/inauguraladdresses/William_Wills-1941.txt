Inaugural address of  William H. Wills   As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1941  Thursday, January 9, 1941. Inaugural Address  Members of the General Assembly: “Government is a trust, and the officers of the government are trustees and both the trust and the trustees are created  for  the  benefit  of  the  people.”  These  words,  spoken  by  Henry  Clay  in  1829,  have  a  fresh  significance today. I  appreciate  the  honor  conferred  upon  me  by  the  State  and  I  am  fully  aware  of  the  responsibilities  of  the great office entrusted to me by the people of Vermont. It makes me  particularly  happy  to  know  there  are  in  this Assembly  so many with whom  I  have  served,  and those with whom  I have worked  so  closely on  the State’s business. Before us  lies  a great  task, and  together we shall meet it. It will  be my  aim  as Governor  to  offer  only  constructive  criticism —  to  avoid merely  tearing  down when  I cannot  suggest  a  practicable  improvement,  Our  joint  efforts  should  be  to  keep  pace  with  progress  while  still keeping faith with Vermont traditions. In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  of  the  State  of  Vermont  relative  to  the  duties  of  the Chief  Executive,  appear  before  the  General  Assembly  today  to  speak  to  you  and  through  you  to  the  people  of our Commonwealth. We  meet  at  a  critical  hour;  abroad  free  institutions  by  the  score  have  been  wrecked  by  ruthless  tyrants  so that  few  traces  remain  of  governmental  structures  under  which  mankind  possessed  liberty  of  action,  thought, and speech. We  in  Vermont,  in  America,  are  deeply  concerned;  we  are  resolved  that  here  we  will  be  vigilant  to  guard and to defend the republican form of government and our way of life. The  decay  of  fallen  republics  overseas  has  been  caused  not  alone  by  an  over-zealous  tyrant;  it  and  the  dry rot with which they have been afflicted first had their origin in a disillusioned unthinking, incompetent people. The  germs  of  the  disease,  which  has  proved  fatal  elsewhere,  are  present  in  our  body  politic;  preventive measures must be taken. The  challenge  which  confronted  those  republics  faces  us  today.  We  have  the  ability  to  surmount  the difficulties, to retain our liberties, to safeguard our institutions. The  antidote  lies  in  your  hands,  in  those  of  the  judiciary,  in  mine,  in  those  of  the  freemen  of  the  State  of Vermont: namely, laws wisely conceived, intelligently interpreted, discreetly administered strictly enforced, and by all willingly obeyed. We  in  Vermont,  as  elsewhere,  must  learn  to  recognize  and  render  ineffective  all  attempts  of  subversive groups  to  undermine  our  governmental  structure  or  shatter  public  morale  by  creating  dissension  and  discord among us. Mere  lip-service  to  the  letter  of  democracy,  however,  is  not  enough.  There  must  be  clear  thinking  and positive action. The  task  is not easy;  it  requires courage, self-reliance, and hard work. Yet,  liberty  is not  for  the weak; it is for the strong in spirit. Today  our  country  is  engaged  in  a  vast,  far-reaching  program  of  industrial  mobilization  and  national rearmament. In it we all share, since the strength of our armed forces is determined by the productiveness of our civil population. We must play our part unstintingly, wholeheartedly, and with singleness of purpose. I  am  confident  that  the  country  needs  no  reassurance  that  toward  this  end  Vermont,  and  Vermonters generally,  will  contribute  their  all  if  necessary.  They  will  cooperate  to  the  fullest  possible  extent  in  order  to preserve and conserve the priceless heritage which we have so long enjoyed. SECTION I I  have  several  subjects  pertaining  to  the  vast  program  of  our  State  to  discuss  with  you.  Passing  reference may be made  to State  finances but  the detail on  this subject will be  included  in my budget  recommendations  to be made to you at a later date. The following matters, important to the welfare of our people, I do wish to call to your attention today. OLD AGE ASSISTANCE The  problem  of  caring  for  the  needy  old  aged  has  been  searchingly  discussed  in  previous  legislative sessions. In my budget recommendations  there has been provided an  increase of $75,000 above the previous biennial appropriation.  This  provides  $600,000.00  for  1942  and  $600,000.00  for  1943, making  a  total  of  $1,200,000  in State funds and the additional appropriation when matched by the Federal government will provide $150,000.00 additional new money for old age assistance payments. So,  with  State  and  Federal  contributions,  total  expenditures  under  this  program  in  Vermont  during  the biennial period will be approximately $2,400,000 for assistance to the aged, burial expenses, and administration of the State law. It  is  the  hope  that  with  an  improvement  in  general  business  condition  together  with  payment  under  other Federal Social Security programs, further increases in State appropriations will not be necessary. UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION The complex nature of this law, and its necessarily involved administration, leads me to say briefly that I am sure  the Commission will  recommend such  liberalization of  its provisions as may be socially and economically sound. PUBLIC WELFARE State assistance  to  the needy and physically handicapped has become a grave  fiscal problem.  In one way or another, the State assists in supporting dependent mothers, dependent children, the blind and the crippled. These dependents deserve assistance and aid for them should be continued. The proper administration of these services is of vital concern to us all. Recommendations respecting proper inter-relationships  between  the  State  and  the  municipalities  will  no  doubt  be  contained  in  the  report  of  the special  commission  authorized  by  the  General  Assembly  of  1939.  I  recommend  a  careful  study  of  this  whole problem. The evident  trend  toward  integration of welfare administration  to avoid duplication of services and controls seems  to  indicate  that  ever  increasing  responsibilities must be  assumed by  the State. With  the  increase  in  these responsibilities,  it  is  incumbent  upon  you  to  apportion  these  benefits  among  all  the  people  so  that  the  greatest good  is  done  for  the  greatest  number;  this  must  be  done  with  a  view  to  place  the  least  possible  burden, consistent with duty and our general welfare, upon the productive forces of the State. There are human values as well as financial aspects in all this work, both important. EDUCATION Rural Schools Vermont’s economic, social, even physical and moral future welfare is in the hands of our grade teachers — “As  the  twig  is bent  so  the  tree’s  inclined,”  and  if Democracy  is  to  continue,  it must begin with  the  training of our young. My predecessor, acting under authority granted him by statute, has recently established a salary schedule for all  State  employees  providing  for  a minimum  salary  and  promotion  according  to  rating  and  ability. Obviously, our  teachers,  competently  trained  in  our  State Normal  Schools  and  constantly  attuned  to  progressive  standards in education,  to whom we entrust our children during  the most  important years of their lives, should have equal consideration. Teachers’  salaries  are  now  fixed  by  the  Towns,  and  it  is  my  recommendation  that  future  steps  be  taken, under our State Aid policy, in continued cooperation with the towns, toward a standardization of salaries. Standardization of Schools I recommend that the rural school improvement plan be continued. Teacher Training Allowance  has  been made  in  the  regular  budget  for  increased  scholarships  and  additions  to Normal  School libraries.  Vocational Education This  is  an  expanding  subject which  deserves most  careful  thought. The National Defense  program  calls  for occupational  training,  and  there  is  a  demand  for  increased  instruction  in  trades  and  industries  as  well  as  in agriculture and home economics.   I believe we must approach the ideal through a broader cooperative program, extending  our  school  facilities  to  out-of-school  youths  and  adults,  and  authorizing  the  training  of  teachers  for vocational education. High Schools I  recommend  continued  efforts  in  standardization  and  a  broadened  curriculum  to  meet  the  present  day standards  for  college  entrance  and  requirements  for  adjustments  and  employment  after  the  completion  of High School. Temperance Education In my opinion the laws requiring temperance education in the schools need to be implemented further. HIGHWAY SAFETY The  problem  of  safety  becomes  more  serious  as  the  development  of  speed  continues  and  winter  driving increases. For  the purpose of  coordinating  the  safety  activities  of  the many  excellent organizations  in our State which  are  promoting  traffic  safety  and  for  the  purpose  of  cooperating  with  enforcement  agencies  engaged  in accident prevention, a properly organized State Safety Commission would be of great value.   It  is  my  opinion  that  to  accomplish  the  greatest  safety  results  the  educational  program  which  has  been worked  out  and  is  popularly  known  as  the Vermont  State  Safety Commission  should  be  enacted  into  law,  thus superseding the Governor’s Highway Safety Council which expires April 1, 1941. As  this  is  a  highway  problem,  I  believe  the  funds  for  the  purpose  should  come  from  Motor  Vehicle Revenue. Highways and Bridges The  Bureau  of  Public  Roads  and  the  War  Department  have  designated  845.2  miles  on  the  Federal  Aid System  as  strategic  highways  in Vermont.  It may,  therefore,  become  necessary  that we  spend  all  or  part  of  the federal funds on these designated highways. This is in line with, defense regulations as to highway policy in the United  States.  This  also  will  involve  Federal  Aid  secondary  funds  which  may  of  necessity  be  used  for  access roads in and around military areas; however, an effort is being made by the New England Governors to have the federal government provide independent funds for this work.  I wish  to  call  to  your  attention  a  problem which will  come  before  you  for  consideration —  the Missisquoi Bridge  at  Swanton.  From  a  careful  study,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  payments  on  the  bonds  can  be  met  by  the Bridge Commission if, during the coming biennial period, aid is rendered by the Highway Board in maintaining the approaches. The cross-state highway between Newport and Richford has now been put on  the Federal Aid System. That indicates that this important link of highway may be built within a reasonable length of time.  MOTOR VEHICLE REVENUE The  revenue  from motor  vehicle  registrations,  drivers  licenses,  and  gasoline  tax  should  continue  to  be  used as  in  the  past,  solely  for  highway  purposes  and  should  not  be  diverted  to  other  uses.  It  should  be  handled  by each  legislature, however;  to  lock  this money up by Constitutional amendment  in any way  is,  I believe, unwise and unsound.  AVIATION Vermont  now  stands  forty-seventh  among  the  states  in  progress  in  aviation.  Therefore,  I  recommend  that this  Legislature  give  consideration  to  the  question  of  State  policy  respecting  development  of  ports  and  fields, consideration of which is now left entirely to the financial ability and the initiative of the towns and cities. This program raises  the question: If under present policy we can do our share  in providing sites for fields needed for national defense and our own development? STATE PLANNING BOARD In  addition  to  the  research  work  regularly  carried  on  by  this  agency,  there  is  need  that  their  work  on interstate  streams  and  their  cooperative  work  with  the  Motor  Vehicle  Department  and  with  local  agencies  on airports  and  airfields  be  continued.  Further,  there  is much  that  the  Planning Board  can  do  to  assist  the work  of the State Defense Council,  SECTION II I find that on the whole our departments are manned by a conscientious, efficient and loyal group of people. However, new times and changing conditions demand new standards, so I want to discuss: THE MERIT SYSTEM The Legislature  of  1939  authorized  a Special Commission  to  study State  employment  conditions,  positions and salaries with a view to establish a merit system for State employees. At the present time, employees in those State Departments operated in part by federal funds are governed by a  system  conforming  to  federal  requirements.  It  is my belief  that  a merit  system  in  all  departments  of  the State would  be  advantageous  both  to  employees  and  to  our  State  government.  I  urge  you  to  give  most  careful consideration to legislation authorizing such a policy. COMPTROLLER I am deeply impressed with the responsibility of  the Governor for  the administration of an annual budget of more than eleven million dollars. And I appeal to you for legislative authority to establish an office to be known as the Office of the Comptroller to assist the Governor in the discharge of his responsibilities as chief executive officer  of  the  State’s  extensive  and  involved  business  establishment.  It  is  not  my  purpose,  nor  wish  to  disrupt the work  of  the  Treasurer  and Auditor  but  rather  to  correlate  their  duties with  the  duties  of  a  comptroller who would be directly responsible to the Governor in carrying out the fiscal program voted by the Legislature. Several  states  have  reorganized  their  business  procedure,  during  the  past  twenty  years,  in  accordance  with the plan  I have  in mind. The  results  in  all  cases,  so  far as  I  have  been  able  to  ascertain,  have  been  satisfactory. Consequently,  there  is  not  only  precedent  for  the  plan  of  reorganization  I  should  like  to  propose  but  also experience to which you may refer in working out the legislation needed. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT Since  the  depression  began,  ten  years  ago,  much  attention  has  been  focused  on  the  problem  of unemployment. This  has  been  nationwide. National  defense  is  bound  to  remedy  this  in  some  localities,  at  least temporarily. Here  in Vermont, however, we have a situation which has grown steadily worse over  the past fifty years.    An  analysis  of  census  figures  makes  us  realize  that  we  must  face  an  unpleasant  situation  and  find  a remedy for it. Between  1930  and  1940  Vermont  lost  population.  This  despite  the  influx  of  new  residents  and  despite  a favorable birth to death ratio.  During these ten years nearly 30,000 Vermonters, or more than the population of Burlington,  left  the  state.  Most  of  those  leaving  belonged  to  the  so-called  productive-age-group  —  twenty  to forty-five years. This  exodus  of  younger  Vermonters  has  been  going  on  for  several  decades.  As  an  unfortunate  result, Vermont  has  a  progressively  smaller  proportion  of  people  in  this  productive  age  group  (20  to  45)  and  an increasingly larger proportion in the older group (65 and over) than does New England or the nation. Our  towns  have  thus  been  losing  population  steadily.  If  this  trend  is  allowed  to  continue  we must  face  the necessity  either  of  reorganizing  our  historic  town-unit-system  form  of  government  or  of  increasing  the  burden on those who remain and denying to them many of the social gains that have thus far been made. We  are  justly proud of  the  accomplishments  that  sons and daughters of Vermont have made  in  all walks of life —  after  they  have  left  the  state.  But  do  we  ever  think  what  Vermont  might  be  today  if  even  a  part  of  the energy and creative genius which left us could have found opportunity for development at home?  Why have the young  folks  left?  Chiefly  because  we  failed  to  make  room  for  them  here  and  did  not  give  them  faith  in  our future.  They  felt  that  they  could  not  find  the  means  of  earning  a  living  and  that  there  was  no  outlet  for  their abilities: jobs and opportunities were lacking. While  this  migration  of  our  young  people  has  been  going  on  —  expansion  of  industry  has  offered  the outstanding  but  neglected  possibility  for  the  needed  extensive  increase  of  employment  opportunity  and  an expanded market for more of our agricultural products. Prompted not only by a desire to see a betterment of industry, with a consequent increase in taxable sources and  the  enlarged  opportunities  that  would  be  offered,  but  more  particularly  from  a  desire  for  the  general betterment  of  Vermont,  I  suggest  to  you  that  at  this  session  of  the  legislature  the  subject  of  the  State’s  policy toward industrial development be given most careful consideration. There must be closer cooperation and better understanding between government and business. I do not  think of  a program  for  industry whereby Vermont would be made  a heavily  industrialized  area nor by  which  mammoth  factories  would  be  located  here;  either  of  these  alternatives  would  be  harmful  rather  than beneficial.    As  I  see  it  the  greatest  benefit  will  come  from  locating  small  to  medium  size  units  here  and  there about the state while at the same time substantially preserving present natural conditions. 1. We  cannot  afford  to  foster  sweat-shop  industry,  relying  as  it  does  either  on  sweating  labor  or  exploiting the locality. 2.  We  cannot  afford  industries  such  as  smelters,  which  in  their  operation  destroy  all  vegetation  in  the surrounding  area.  Neither  can  we  afford  industries  which  destroy  other  natural  resources  or  that  make  living intolerable in their vicinity. 3. We  need  and  should  have  industries  that  can  use  not  only  an  increasing  amount  of  agricultural  products and crops adaptable to our climate and soils but those other resources with which we are so richly endowed.  4.  Most  desirable  in  my  opinion,  are  those  industries  whose  products  are  worthy  of  the  Vermont-quality label.  Particularly,  those  industries  which  depend  for  success  more  on  a  supply  of  loyal,  cooperative,  non-transient  labor  so  characteristic of  that  to be  found  in Vermont  than on  low material  cost,  low  transportation or other low operating cost. For  such  industries  Vermont,  with  modern  means  of  transportation,  offers  many  outstanding  advantages. Today,  honesty  and  good-housekeeping  in  State  and  Municipal  government  as  reflected  by  reasonable  taxes, laws  and  law  enforcement,  is  frequently  more  important  to  industrial  success  and  harmony  than  is  a  location close to sources of materials or markets. I  believe  an  effort  to  increase  our  industrial  establishments  is wise  and  timely.  I  suggest  that,  to  obtain  the greatest  benefit  to  the  state,  an  industrial  agent  be  authorized  by  you  and  an  agency  for  this  purpose  be established; that this agency may be given at least three duties 1. To survey possible available properties and assist our existing industries to meet their problems. 2, To  encourage  and  give  assistance,  other  than  in  financing,  to Vermont  citizens  in  establishing  new  local enterprises. 3. To develop and carry on the effort to attract the right kind of industry to Vermont. To carry out  these duties effectively,  this agency  should be  set up with a director of outstanding ability and he should be authorized to employ, temporarily, such technical consultants or advisors as may be necessary. I feel strongly, for the reasons I have outlined, that you should enact necessary legislation to put this plan, or a better one, into operation. SECTION III In  addition  to  legislation  necessary  to  implement  any  or  all  of  these  changes  in  organization,  there  are certain others I suggest for your deliberation, namely: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT I  direct  your  attention  to  the  fact  that,  following  the  procedure  laid  down  in  the  Constitution,  proposals  to amend that document may be offered during this session. In your deliberations,  it  should not be overlooked  that once an amendment  is made  to  the Constitution over twelve years must elapse before it can be modified or repealed.   Therefore,  I  suggest  that  unusual  care  be  taken  in  initiating  any  amendment  to  the  Constitution  and  that consideration be given only to those designed for the lasting good of our State. STATE REPORTS The  people,  under  our  democratic  process,  are  the  owners  or  stockholders  of  the  governmental establishment.  There  seems  to  be  no  good  reason  therefore,  why  State  Department  Reports  should  not  be  as understandable in their presentation as are newspapers, magazines and scientific journals.  ENABLING LEGISLATION Power Plants For  many  sessions,  the  General  Assembly  has  had  presented  to  it  for  enactment  special  bills,  to  enable individual  municipalities  to  construct  and  operate  local  electric  power  plants.  These  measures  have  consumed the valuable  time of  the entire body when  it would  seem  that  such  time might more profitably have been given to problems involving the state, as a whole. I, therefore, recommend to you that a general enabling act be passed that will dispose of the matter on a state-wide basis, enabling any local geographical unit or political subdivision of our State  to construct and operate such a utility, provided  the standards of  the state-wide enabling act be met by protecting cities or towns, the taxpayer and the private concern. Should this recommendation meet with your approval, such an act should of course be so drafted that it will be  fair  to  the  unit  fostering  the  development,  the  individual  members  of  that  unit,  privately  established  public utilities, and to the state as a whole SESQUI-CENTENNIAL In  1791 Vermont  became  the  first  state  after  the  original  thirteen  colonies  to  be  admitted  to  statehood.  It  is this year that we celebrate the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of that memorable event. The Commission appointed  to make plans and preparations for  the recognition and celebration of  that event will  shortly  place  in  your  hands  their  report.  I  ask  your  cooperation  in  considering  and  carrying  out  the suggestions therein made. SABOTAGE Maintenance  of  our  internal  security  is  a  joint  responsibility.  The  times  demand  wholehearted  cooperation between  Federal  and  State  law-enforcement  agencies.    In  this  national  emergency  I  am  convinced  that  our sabotage statutes are inadequate, and recommend a careful study and revision where necessary.  FEDERAL AID Local  and  State  government  is  increasingly  dependent  upon  federal  aid  to  meet  many  of  their responsibilities  increasing  reliance  is  placed  in  federal  subsidy.    I  wish  to  offer  one  word  of  caution:  the  huge amount  of  such  aid  now  being  granted  cannot  continue  indefinitely.    There  may  come  a  day  when  it  will  be unavailable.   We must  in  the meantime,  in  looking  to  such  a  day,  strive  to make  ourselves  as  strong  and  self-reliant as possible. TRADE BARRIERS Should  it  develop  that  legislation  is  introduced  that  may  tend  to  interfere  with  free  intercourse  of  trade between  our  state  and  the  sister  states,  I  ask  you  to  weigh  carefully  the  desirability  of  such  legislation  lest  we unwittingly  increase  trade  barriers  between  the  states  and  thereby  increase  the  demand  for  more  federal regulation of interstate transactions. SECTION IV Now I come to the life blood of our vitality, the sources of our state’s income and the health of the economic basis from which that income is derived. AGRICULTURE Agriculture is one of the most important industries in our state. Cash farm income in Vermont, not including income  from,  tourists  and work  off  the  farm  during  the  past  year was  about  $43,000,000.00.   This  income was distributed to the many farm families in every town.  It then was used by these families in purchasing the goods and  services which  they  need,  from  “the  butcher,  the  baker,  the  candlestick maker.”   Thus,  it  is  that we  are  all vitally  interested  in  that  farm  income and  it  is  just good business  judgment  for us  to concern ourselves with  the problems involved in this, our great and fundamental industry. About  75  percent  of  our  farm  income  is  derived  from  our  dairies.  In  this  enterprise  we  are  in  competition with  other  areas  and  we  need  efficient  production  and  effective  marketing  if  we  are  to  continue  to  compete successfully. Bang’s Disease One  of  the  great  problems  in  efficient  production  is  the  control  of  devastating  dairy  diseases.  Bang’s disease,  affecting  as  it  does  both  public  health  and,  the  farmer’s  welfare,  is  a  great  menace.  Its  control  is correspondingly important. The Legislature of 1935 provided for State control by the test and slaughter method; additional  measures  authorizing  control  by  other  methods  were  enacted  in  1939.  The  United  States  Bureau  of Animal  Industry has  recently conducted a nationwide experiment  in preventive control by calfhood vaccination which  renders young animals  immune  to  this disease.  If control by  this method  is as effective as  is predicted,  it will  be  of  immeasurable  value  to  both  farmers  and  taxpayers  by  eliminating  the  slaughter  of  so many  valuable animals and payment of huge sums for indemnity. The Department of Agriculture has been studying the various methods  of  control  and  is  prepared  to  submit  amendments  to  the  present  laws.  It  is  recommended  that  this important matter be given careful consideration by the legislature. Herd Improvement It  is  gratifying  to  note  the  increased  development  of  dairy  herd  improvement  projects.  This  indicates  a growing interest and alertness on the part of our farmers, which bids well for future economy in production and consequent improvement in earnings on the farm, Insofar  as  possible,  measures  should  be  taken  to  improve  the  quality  of  our  pastures  and  to  increase  and improve the quality of the winter feeds which we produce. Milk Marketing We have heard  less of milk marketing problems during  the past year or so. Apparently,  the activities of our milk  control board  and  the Federal marketing orders have given general  satisfaction  and helped  to  stabilize  the situation.  I  hope  farmers  may  not  be  led  to  lean  too  heavily  on  these  “props”  but  that  they  will  continue  to  a greater and greater extent to set up their own controls and to solve their own problems. There is one great inefficiency in the handling of milk after it leaves the farm, namely, duplication of plants and  collection  service  in  gathering,  milk  throughout  the  territory.  An  authority  on  this  subject  declares  that  it occasions  the waste  of more  than  $2,000,000.00  annually. This  offers  a  very  fertile  field  for  study  and  activity on  the part of  the cooperative associations  in seeking  to eliminate as much of  that waste and  loss as  is practical and possible. There have been two exhaustive studies made of the milk problem in Vermont by committees authorized by the  legislature.  I believe  that  the State-supported  agricultural  institutions  should  take a positive  action  either by demonstrating  specifically  how  the  suggestions  made  can  be  followed  by  the  individual  farmer  or  by recommending alternatives having the same ultimate objective in view. Diversity in Agriculture But,  dairying  is  not  all;  we  have  many  other  agricultural  enterprises.  Poultry  production  is  growing  in importance.    Our  farm  forest  products,  maple  sugar  and  syrup,  lumber,  pulp  wood  and  cord  wood,  altogether comprise a considerable part of Vermont  farm  income but not so much as  they might under good management. Other enterprises are: potatoes, apples,  small  fruit and vegetables, honey and many others — and we  should be constantly  seeking  additional ones.    It  is usually unwise  to have  all our  eggs  in one basket  and we will be wise to be seeking new crops and other products we can produce. Industrial Agricultural Products Commission The  Industrial  Agricultural  Products  Commission  has  been  most  effective  in  its  program  for  a  more profitable diversified agriculture and utilization of our land.  In their help is offered a partial solution of another situation  with  which  Vermont  has  long  been  confronted,  the  loss  to  our  state  of  its  younger  people.  Youth demands opportunity:  it exist on our own farms here in Vermont it has been made attractive in many individual instances; it can and must be made so generally. Rural Electrification As  a means  of  solving  this  problem,  continued  rural  electrification  should  be  encouraged.  The Grange,  the Farm  Bureau,  the  Extension  Service,  the  Public  Service  Commission,  and  private  utility  companies  under  the coordinating influence of an energetic Rural Electrification Board should exert every effort to bring the benefits of  electrical  service  to  all  by  a  continuing  increase  in  this  field  in which  so  fine  a  start  has  already  been made. Let’s stimulate these efforts to a finish.  Cooperatives Cooperative organizations are commanding greater interest in all parts of the nation, not only in agricultural pursuits  but  among  consumers  as  well.  Vermont  has  reason  to  be  proud  of  the  development  of  its  cooperative creamery  associations.  Their  growth  in  the  past  twenty  years  has  been  substantial.  They  appear  to  have  been built  on  a  foundation  that  is  enduring.  Their  growth  is  testimony  to  the  fact  that  they  have  fulfilled  a  mission needed  by  their  membership.  They  appear  ever-willing  to  push  forward  by  seeking  legitimate  aid  for  the farmers through practical and workable marketing order. It is my opinion that the future for Vermont farmers is made brighter  through  the activity of  these associations and particularly by  reason of  their growing  tendency  to work in closer harmony as a group. Future for Agriculture In  order  to  hold  a  truly  competitive  position with  other  sections  of  the  country, we must  gird  ourselves  for activity of a constructive character which may call for  the abandonment of some of our prejudices of years past and force us to look forward with a determination and courage that will lead to the improvement of our average farm  incomes. The Vermont farmer still has advantages not found anywhere else  in the country. His are not  the problems of the dust bowls, artificial irrigation and such. Nature has endowed Vermont with an abundant supply of  water,  with  fertile  lands  for  cultivation,  with  rich  pastures  and  woodlots.  Geographically,  too,  he  has  the advantage  in  its nearness  to markets. The  farmer, as well as every one else, must make adjustments  to meet  the contingencies of the times, but the essential benefits in our Vermont country life can not be evaluated in dollars and  cents.  By  discounting  the  future  on  our  farms,  we  fail  to  keep  pace  with  the  times  or  to  keep  faith  with youth. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS The wise  action of  previous  legislatures  in  treating  and maintaining  a Department of  Industrial Relations  is unquestioned.  It  is  to  this  agency  of  our State  government  labor  and  industry  look  for  counsel;  here  they meet, here  they  learn  their  respective  rights  under  existing  law.  Such  a  vital  activity  of  our  State  government, important to both labor and industry, should be encouraged and implemented. The problems of labor deserve your earnest consideration I ask that in the consideration of labor legislation, you  seriously  weigh  the  representations  of  that  group.  Our  aim  must  be  to  preserve  our  state  as  a  healthy community  of  satisfied  citizens,  working  together  in  the  Vermont  tradition  of  unity.  I  am  sure  that  you  are conscious of this, and I know you will have that always in mind. You  and  I  realize  that  if we  have  a  prosperous  state,  there must be unity  among  agriculture,  labor,  industry and  business.  The  success  of  each  is  dependent  on  the  success  of  the  others.  We  do  not  believe  that  we  can strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. Neither do we believe that we can further the brotherhood of man by pitting class against class. RECREATION I  am  impressed  to  find  that  our  recreation  business  yields  about  $28,000.000.00  annually.  In  her  natural resources  Vermont  today  possesses  unique  and  often  unappreciated  assets  of  invaluable  importance  to  her spiritual and economic welfare. Our  soil,  valleys,  mountains,  forests,  water  resources  and  wild  life  must  not  merely  be  taken  for  granted. Fortunate  are we  that  they  are  here  for  our  use,  enjoyment,  and  financial  benefit,  but  in  using  them we  are  not sole owners with a right to exhaust or to destroy.  Instead we are trustees privileged to enjoy and use them while we  operate  the  state. We must  ever  be  careful  lest we  destroy  the  benefits which  by  right  should  belong  to  the Vermonters of the future. TAXATION We  all must  realize  that government  cannot operate without  funds  and  that only  through  the  taxing process can  these funds be raised;  it  is from  the purse of each of us  that  this money comes. The smaller amount we pay in  direct  or  indirect  taxes,  the  more  dollars  will  remain  for  us  to  spend  as  we  wish.  The  power  to  tax  is  the power  to destroy.    I  feel sure  that in your hands  this power will be prudently used and  that you will continue  to respect  Vermont’s  traditional  pay-as-you-go  policy.  We  in  Vermont  do  not  believe  that  we  can  bring  about prosperity by discouraging  thrift. Neither do we believe  that we can keep out of  trouble by  spending more  than our income. In the true Vermont fashion, let us cut our pattern to fit our cloth. AMUSEMENT MACHINES The Legislature of 1937 legalized mechanical devices known as amusement machines by licensing their use. The use of  these machines has been  the  cause of much grief and  I now urge  the  repeal of  this  law.  I appreciate fully  that  this would mean  some  loss of  revenue  to  the State, but  I do  feel  that  the  income  lost  is  insufficient  to offset the moral damage under this license. STATE OFFICE BUILDING I  wish  to  call  to  your  attention  today  a  serious  condition  which  exists  in  the  business  operation  of  our government.  I  hope  for  favorable  action  by  this  legislature  on  the  suggestion  that  I  now  advance  for  your consideration. We  are  in  dire  need  of  an  adequate  office  building.  We  suffer  from  a  lack  of  the  facilities  that  it  would afford. The  first  and  most  important  improvement  to  result  from  its  construction  would,  be  the  establishment  of proper safeguards to life and property under existing circumstances. I  am  informed  that  the  old  National  Life  building  now  occupied  by  the  State,  is  in  a  dangerous  structural condition  owing  overloading;  the  boilers  in  the Library  building  constitute  a  serious  fire  and  explosion  hazard. The lives of the many employees and the property of the State in these two buildings are constantly endangered. The  Attorney  General  has  informed  the  Sergeant-at-Arms  that  the  responsibility  for  the  safety  of  the  lives  of those  persons  and  the  property  of,  the  State  rests  with  the  Governor.    I  herewith  and  now,  hand  that  grave responsibility to you.  I am informed by competent authority that no high pressure boiler should be placed under such a valuable building containing property which can never be replaced. Safeguards  to  life  and  property,  although  they  are  serious  problems,  are  not,  however;  the  only considerations  involved,  The  financial  loss,  through  inefficiency  in  operation  and  impediments  to  cooperative action  between  various  departments  scattered  throughout  the  city  of Montpelier  cannot  readily  be  appraised  in dollars and cents; but a careful study of the unfortunate condition indicates that it is considerable.  There  is now being paid out  in  rents nearly nine  thousand dollars annually  for State occupied quarters. This amount will increase as leases expire and operations further expand. The  State  Governments  business  has  increased  during  the  past  few  years  far  beyond  our  expectations.  No new building to remedy this additional crowded condition has been undertaken since 1919. Most of our buildings and nearly all of the rented quarters are not fireproof structures. Irreplaceable damage and  great  financial  loss  would  result  were  our  records,  documents,  surveys  and  summaries  of  experiments  so vital to our everyday operations destroyed by fire. We  are  at  the  cross-roads  on  this  subject.  It  will  probably  be  many  years  before  we  can  build  so advantageously  and  at  so  low  a  cost.  I  trust  that  positive  action  will  no  longer  be  delayed  on  this  extremely important matter. A building of suitable design and construction to conform to the State House and Annex, with provision for future development  and needs, which would give  the State  adequate  office,  and  storage  facilities,  I  am  advised by  competent  authority,  would  cost  approximately  six  hundred  thousand  dollars,  for  which  we  have  sufficient cash  in  the  General  Fund.  The  steady  improvement  in  business  has  provided  substantially  more  General  Fund revenues  through  taxation,  licenses and  fees  than  the amounts used  in budget  estimates.   By  June 30, 1940,  the Treasurer  had  accumulated  a  free  cash  balance  in  the  General  Fund  of  $1,080,214.20.    Since  then,  collections have  continued  to  exceed  budget  forecasts.  Consequently,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  State  will  again close  its  books  next  June with  a  free  cash  balance  of  something more  than  a million  dollars,  after  carrying  out the financial program authorized by the Legislature of 1939. SOLDIERS’ BONUS The balance of surplus cash, in my opinion, should be set aside as a reserve against the State’s obligation for a  soldiers’  bonus  that may  accrue  if  and when  the National Guard  is  inducted  into  the Federal Service. Section 8057  of  the  Public  Laws  provides  that,  “Enlisted  men  of  the  militia,  National  Guard,  and  volunteers  in  the service  of  the United  States  shall  be  paid  by  the  State  the  sum  of  ten  dollars  each  per month  in  addition  to  the pay  which  they  shall  receive  from  the  Federal  government  provided  that  the  period  for  which  such  state  pay shall  be  allowed  shall  not  exceed  one  year.”  It  is  estimated  that  this  extra  pay  for  our  soldiers  would approximate three hundred thousand dollars, for which there is no provision in the budget. Moreover  the  Legislature  should  also  consider  the  establishment  of  a  Home  Guard  to  substitute  for  the National  Guard  while  the  latter  is  in  federal  service.  I  am  advised  that  adequate  equipment  for  the  purpose would cost $25,000 and I suggest that the expenditure also be financed with surplus cash. CASH SURPLUS Before  leaving  the  problem  of  financing  the  new  office  building  proposed  and  the  prospective  soldiers’ bonus,  I  should  like  to  remind you  that  the  accumulation of  cash  surplus  is unusual,  and  for  that  reason  should not,  be  used  for  recurring  items  or  depleting  revenue  for  the  future. This  surplus  accumulated  because General Fund Revenue  collections  through  an unexpected  improvement  in business exceeded  reasonable estimates with which  our  biennial  budget  was  concerned.  Therefore,  I  sincerely  hope  that  this  Legislature  in  its  financial deliberations will at all times consider that the revenue estimates to be submitted in my executive budget are the maximum  amounts  which  we  can  reasonably  expect  during  the  coming  biennial  period,  as  all  of  the  revenue estimates have been raised to new heights — conservative but not elastic. SECTION V My message to you would be incomplete if I neglected to call to your attention a fundamental weakness and a trend, which, in my opinion, have much to do with our uneasiness and spirit of unrest. We have great meetings and  discussions  on  economic  subjects,  but  the  citizens  of  Vermont  are  not  giving  adequate  attention  to  the spiritual needs of the individual and of the State as a whole; We comment about the break-down of morals both within  the  State  and  the  Nation  but  fail  to  recognize  the  fact  that  it  may  be  due,  and  in  my  opinion  is  due  in large  measure,  to  the  spiritual  indifference  of  citizens. We  comment  frequently  on  the  prosperity  of  a  bygone age  but  seldom  in  our  passing  comments  do  we  connect  the  two  thoughts  that  the  people  of  yesterday  were pious  and  devout  in  the matter  of  their  religious  beliefs  and  practices. We  as  individuals would  do well within our respective communities to join with others in serious study, analysis and action, toward reviving interest and stimulating activity  in  the  realm of our spiritual needs.  If America  is  to be  saved, each  individual must  first put his own house  in order. The Ten Commandments  cannot be  improved upon, nor  can  the Sermon on  the Mount be surpassed as a guide for ethical conduct. The Governor having concluded  the  reading of his message, was escorted  to  the Executive Chamber by  the committee appointed by the Chair. The Join Assembly dissolved. Rawson C. Myric, Secretary of State, Clerk.
