Inaugural Address  of  Richard A. Snelling   as it appears in the   JOURNAL  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY   BIENNIAL SESSION  1977  Address Thursday, January 6, 1977 Inaugural Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the General Assembly. Although I know that I am no longer entitled to points of personal privilege in this body, I should like to ask your  indulgence  that  I might say a personal word before  I begin  the more  traditional comments expected of me this day. I do want to say how glad I am to see so many Former Governors and their First Ladies here today. I want to say  that  I  miss,  and  I  am  sure  that  you  all  do,  the  presence  of  Deane  and  Marjory  Davis.  I  know  that  you  all pray,  as  I  do,  that  they  will  be  back  among  us  shortly  and  in  good  health.  I  want  particularly  to  tell  you  how good  it  is  to  be  back  in  this  Hall  among  so  many  treasured  friends.  Remembering  how  moved  I  was  by  your generosity  to  me  on  the  occasion  when  I  said  good  bye  to  you  last  year  uncertain  then  if  I  would  ever  have  a future  opportunity  to  work  with  you.  So  it  is  a  particular  joy  to  have  the  pleasure  to  be  back  here  again.  I  do want  to  tell  you  before  I  start  that  I  understand  in  our  common  cause  we  must  now  proceed  down  different roads.  I  hope  that  you will  be  permitting me  to  continue  to  think  of  you  as my  personal  friends  as well  as my colleagues without  fearing  that  I will obscure  the  important separation between  the branches. Above all,  I want you to know how much I respect the legislative process. We are sure to disagree from time to time but when we do,  I  will  always  know  that  your  sense  of  responsibility,  your  thoughtfulness  will  be  no  less  than  mine,  only different.  What  you  have  taught  me  in  this  Chamber  cannot  be  un-learned.  I  told  you  as  I  said  good  bye  that there are other offices in the State of Vermont other than Legislator, but to me, there is none higher. I also want to  take  this  occasion  to  express my  appreciation  and,  I  believe  that  of Vermont,  to Governor  Thomas  Salmon. What  he  has  done  for  me  and  you,  I  believe,  this  last  nine  weeks  in  making  it  possible  for  me  to  start  early studying  that  which  needed  to  be  studied  in  preparation  with  his  staff.  I  am  sure  that  other  Governors  have assisted those who were going to take their place, but although I have known Tom for many years and liked him we  could not  call  each other personal  friends  and we were of different parties but he  spared  absolutely nothing to give me the best opportunity to start this work, this day. I think that that deserves to become the tradition and I pledge to you that I will do no less for those who follow me. Mr.  President,  Mr.  Speaker,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  Distinguished  Former  Governors  and  their  First  Ladies, Members of the Judiciary, Distinguished Guests and Members of the General Assembly. On this occasion, one hundred years, three months, and one day ago, Governor Horace Fairbanks said about Vermonters—“In  the  memorable  year  of  1777  .  .  .  though  claimed  on  the  east  by  New  Hampshire,—claimed and  menaced  on  the  west  by  New  York,—oppressed  and  warred  against  on  the  north  by  Great  Britain,—unrecognized  and  unsupported  by  the  sister  colonies,  they,  a  mere  handful  of  sturdy  yeomen,  stood  manfully and independently for the right. May the same infinite wisdom guide us in all legislative deliberations . . .” “Standing on  the dividing  line of  the centuries,  it  is  the part of wisdom  to consider not alone  the present,  its comforts and privileges, but as well  the past,  that we may  learn  their cost,  their  lessons, and  take warning  from any mistakes by the way, and that we may plan broadly, intelligently and wisely for the future.” So spoke Governor Fairbanks one hundred years ago today. * * * I could not accept the honor and challenge of delivering the message which tradition calls upon me to make this day without the counsel and perspective of those who have preceded me in such a challenge.  And so I have been reading the gubernatorial messages delivered in Vermont through these years. To  do  so  is  to marvel  at  the  genius,  the  optimism,  the  versatility,  and  the  abiding  courage  and  faith  in God which  are  revealed  by  those  messages,  not  alone  of  the  men  who  spoke  them,  but  as  those  qualities  are  fully revealed  in  the  character  of  the  free  men  and  women  with  whom  they  shared  hopes  and  fears,  burdens  and goals. History  has  its  lessons,  and  its  perspectives.    It  is  at  once  intimidating  and  encouraging.    It must  intimidate us and humble us to know that so many great men and women have preceded us in these halls and set so high a standard of service and accomplishment against which we must measure our worthiness.  But, at the same time, history  furnishes  us  with  encouragement  as  it  notes  that  the  giants  of  the  past  erred,  too,  yet  tried  again  and again—succeeding often enough to let us know man can better himself, failing enough to let us know that they, too, must have had fears and self-doubts. * * * Perhaps one of the repeated lessons of history is that many of the needs of men are never, and can never, be fully satisfied.  We must find and know the limits of what we can do.   While we  find  not  one  single  governor who  turned  away  or who  counseled Vermont  to  turn  away  from  its obligations  to  educate,  to  heal,  to  feed  and  to  house,  to  protect  and  to  build,  we  find  many  who  faced  the dilemma  of  balancing  some  over-riding  need  against  all  others—or  of  weighing  countless  possibilities  for service against limited capability. And, from year to year, we see our forefathers searching for a satisfactory answer to the question which has plagued both philosophers and kings  throughout  recorded history—how can government  serve widely and well without in the process becoming the master instead of the servant? * * * Perhaps,  while  historical  perspective  is  still  sharply  in  mind,  we  should  ask:  What  are  the  prospects  for Vermont as it enters its third century? In the state and in the nation we have traveled for more than a decade through shoal waters.  Now, although we would not  claim  to  be  entirely  free  of  danger,  the way would  surely  seem  to be more  clear,  and  the  risks  at hand  and  ahead  far  less  than  those  that  lie behind.   The nation  is  at peace,  after  a  long  siege which divided her as no war since that between the states.  A national crisis between the generations which for a period seemed to threaten  the  continuity  of  our  basic  beliefs  seems  to  have  passed,  and  parents  and  children,  teachers  and students,  seem  once  again  to  be  communicating  and  learning  from  one  another.    The  dreadful  inflation  of  two years  ago has greatly  subsided.   The deepest  recession  this  country has  seen  since  the great depression  reached its  turning  point  in  April  of  1975,  and  for  eighteen  months  this  nation  and  Vermont  have  seen  greater employment, greater productivity and greater confidence among its people. Here  in  Vermont  a  period  of  declining  tax  revenues  is  over.  The  deficit  many  feared  for  the  fiscal  period ending  this  coming  June  30th  will  not  come  to  pass—we  will  end  this  biennium  with  no  deficit,  and  we  will have erased the deficit with which it began. * * * During  the  two  years  for  which  you  will  allocate  spending,  we  can  look  forward  to  a  modest  increase  in revenue  available  from  existing  taxes. The  total  is not  likely  to be  such as  to permit  spending all  that any of us might desire, nor is it so limited as to require us either to turn away from legitimate needs, or to increase taxes. * * * These better times for Vermont are not, unfortunately, and significantly, better times for all Vermonters. We can and will face our obligations to work for improved circumstances for those who have not fully shared in the state’s  progress.  As  we  face  that  challenge,  however,  we  need  not  fail  to  recognize  and  give  thanks,  for  the continued improvement in our opportunities. There are needs, as always, which must be met by increased spending. * * * Once again we are called upon by our Vermont tradition to provide educational opportunities to our children which  will  enable  them  to  step  into  our  places.  The  needs  of  elementary  and  secondary  education,  of  special education  and  of  higher  education,  deserve,  and  I  hope  will  be  assigned,  the  highest  single  priority  among  all proposals for increased spending. It will not be enough, however, for us merely to appropriate larger sums of money.  We must meet, head-on, some  problems  which  have  long  awaited  the  leadership  of  both  the  general  assembly  and  of  the  executive. Governor  Fairbanks  observed  one  hundred  years  ago,  “It  is  not  so  much  the  amount  of  money  which  we expend, as the character which we give to the public schools, that is all important.” The present formula for distributing the state revenue  to supplement  local school appropriations, pleases far fewer Vermonters than it aggravates. I find much of that aggravation justified. I will, therefore, be asking you to consider  legislation  to  correct  the  present  assumption  that  state  funding  should  reach  some  fixed  percentage  of total  educational  costs. My  proposal will  establish  a maximum  cost  for  each  school  student  in  a  school  district against which state reimbursement for basic education can be made. I am also carefully considering a number of proposals for other changes in the present state aid formula. However, any change in the manner of allocation of state support for local education must assure that the change will, in fact, result in a more equitable access of all children to a basic education, and that such access not place a disproportionate hardship on the taxpayers of any town. It is also clear that we must address, once again, the system of equalizing grand lists of the towns so that the respective  tax  bases  of  our  local  school  districts  are  brought  into  line  under  some  common  denominator.    I cannot  tell  whether  it  will  comfort  you  or  dismay  you  to  know  how  long  this  problem  has  plagued  Vermont legislators.  More than a dozen governors have spoken, some with despair, of the issue.  Governor John Page, in 1868, echoed  the  feelings of many of us, saying, “It  is evident  to many who have been called  to administer our assessment  laws  that  the  burdens  of  taxation  do  not  bear  equally  on  all  classes  of  property.”    And  Governor Fairbanks, eight years  later, observed, “Not  infrequently has  it been claimed  that property of  the same kind and value  was  placed  in  the  grand  list  at  different  valuations  in  different  sections  of  the  state.”    He  proposed  a remedy and then he added “Whether such a revision can be effected in a single session of the legislature may be doubtful.”    One  hundred  years  later,  his  appreciation  of  the  scope  of  this  problem  comes  forth  as  a  masterful understatement.   But  in 1977 we must  face  that  issue.   No system of distributing state aid which  takes  the  local  tax base  into consideration  will  work  without  a  reliable  system  of  equalizing  among  the  receiving  districts.    The  legislature has  abolished  the  former  state  property  tax  division,  and  so  it  is  therefore  imperative  that  we  establish  a  new system  for equalization.    I believe  the  time has come  for us  to establish a  regional appraisal  system,  supervised by  a  statewide  lay-board,  and  I  will  support  legislation  similar  to  that  which  was  before  you  last  year  to accomplish this purpose. * * * Vermont  has  been  a  pioneer  in  special  education.    We  are  already  in  the  fifth  year  of  a  ten-year  plan  to search  out  and  adequately  provide  for  the  needs  of  our  exceptional  children.    We  have  been  proceeding  in  a timely and orderly way and are now prepared to accelerate this progress.  It is my proposal that we do so. * * * The  first  legislature  of  the  state  of  Vermont  had  the  vision  to  charter  a  state  university  and  thereby  to express  its  commitment  to  the  advanced  education  of  its  citizens.   Subsequent  legislatures  established  the  state colleges and the community college. Inaugural messages  through  the  years  are  sprinkled with warnings,  still  timely  today,  of  the  need  for  better coordination  and  cooperation of  these  institutions.   We must  satisfy ourselves  that we  are meeting  the needs of Vermonters  in  education,  in  research  and  in  service,  while  avoiding  either  redundancy  or  such  scope  as  to assure continual under-funding of the truly essential programs.   At no time has funding for these institutions of higher learning matched the vision which created them.  The university  and  the  state  colleges  deserve  the  increased  funding  which  will  be  recommended.    To  assure  the availability  of  a  college  education  to  all  qualified  Vermonters  and  to  soften  the  impact  of  recent  tuition increases  at  the  University  of  Vermont,  we  must  also  increase  support  for  the  Vermont  Student  Assistance Corporation. * * * It is inherent in the quality of life which we cherish that neighbors are to be trusted and that all should live in the  comfort  and  peace  of  mind  of  being  secure  in  their  persons  and  property.    Predictable  law  enforcement  is perhaps one of the most basic expectations a people can have of their government.  We  must  substantially  increase  our  capacity  to  protect  people  by  strengthening  and  harmonizing  all elements  of  law  enforcement,  the  state  police,  and  sheriffs  and  the  local  police.    Improved  morale  and delineation of  roles  and  functions  for police officers  is  a  first  step  that must be  accomplished by  a new  attitude towards  the  process  of  prosecution,  corrections  and  parole,  ensuring  that  police,  judges,  state’s  attorneys  and parole  boards  proceed with  shared  objectives.    The message must  be  clear  to  potential  offenders  that  this  state holds  the protection of  its citizens as a matter of deep concern and  there must be no misunderstanding as  to  the intent to enforce the laws. * * * There  are  many  Vermonters  for  whom  this  bright  new  year  does  not  seem  promising.    There  are  men, women  and  children  who  have  needs  that  they  are  presently  unable  to  meet  themselves.    Only  with  sensitive support and assistance will they achieve their highest hope—that of self-accomplishment and self-fulfillment as productive citizens.  Some will not be able to do so even with this help.  And so in the field of human services I also  see  a  pressing  need  for  both  increased  funding  and  for  review  and  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  our various programs. As  inescapable  as  the  financial  needs may  be,  no  less  obvious  is  the  need  for  a  new  and  better  philosophy.  We  have  tended  to  assume  over  the  years  that  suffering  can  be  eliminated  by  increasing  public  expenditures.  That  assumption  is  as wrong  today  as  it was  in  1939 when Governor Aiken  reminded  this  assembly  that  “The importance  of  public  welfare  services  has  grown  far  beyond  the  imagination  of  a  few  years  past.    Public consciousness demands public effort to provide opportunity, to promote security, and to prevent suffering.   The demand for these things has far outstretched the taxpayers’ capacity to pay.”    It  is  my  intention  to  structure  a  system  which  meets  the  real  needs  of  Vermonters  and  gently  but  firmly assisting all who can meet their own needs to be placed in a position to do so. Your  understanding  and  counsel  will  certainly  be  required  as  we  attempt  to  measure  program  against program, goal against accomplishment, rule against result. As  a  first  step,  I  intend  to move  promptly  to  integrate more  fully  the  departments  of  the  agency  of  human services,  in  order  to  facilitate  a more  coordinated  and  comprehensive  delivery  of  effective  assistance.   We will move  to  treat  individuals  and  families  with  attention  to  the  root  problems  of  their  needs.    We  will  seek  to emphasize improvement in the capacity of individuals to earn income, as compared to the provision of services.  We  shall  recommend  strong measures  to  reduce  abuse  of  welfare  funds  and  unemployment  benefits.   We  will maximize the possibilities for coordinating the temporary and permanent job finding facilities at the department of employment security and the federally sponsored comprehensive employment and training office. * * * But we will be  able  to meet our  responsibilities  and  to  realize our opportunities, only  if Vermont  continues to  strive  for  a  strong  economic  base  which  will  provide  a  broader  range  of  employment  opportunities  to  its citizens.    Accordingly,  sound  economic  development  without  unnecessary  expansion  of  population  must  be  a central concern of this legislature, as it will be of my administration. If we will undertake the job of building up each of our great industries in balance—agriculture and forestry, recreation,  and  manufacturing—consistent  with  our  goals  of  conserving  our  unique  Vermont  environment,  we will  be  able  to  withstand  the  effects  of  national  economic  fluctuations  far  better  than  most  other  states.    That, too, is a part of our proud and independent heritage. Any failure to enhance the economic stability of our farms and forests will, over time, inevitably do damage to  the  quality  of  our  environment.    I  will  accordingly  recommend  to  you  several  programs  to  encourage  the increase in productivity and market opportunities of our lands.  Sound  industrial  and  recreational  development  can  live  in  harmony  with  the  preservation  of  our  beautiful Vermont  if we use  imagination and  skill.   We do not have  to choose between adequate  jobs and quality of  life.  We  have  only  to  make  government  attitudes  towards  business  more  constructive—to  reap  the  benefits  of increasingly strong employment and better income opportunities in this uniquely beautiful state. The major  thrust  of  our  efforts must  be  to  raise  the  quality of  jobs  available, not merely  to bring  additional jobs  to  the state.   In doing so, we must  take great care and make great effort  to  improve  the access  to economic development in every part of the state. * * * It  is my  intention  to place  substantial emphasis on  the  role of  the  regional planning  commissions as well as development  groups  in  defining  the  needs  and  resources  of  our  citizens  and  in  creating  the  circumstances  for broad productive use of our natural and our human resources. I  pledge  the  help  and  support  of  this  administration  to  pursue  anew  the  important  goals  of Act  250.    I will, however, be  looking more  to  the  regions and  to  the  local municipalities,  for  their help  to achieve  these goals.    I will  further  endeavor  to  complete  the  program  to  assure  for  future  generations  that  our  Vermont  streams  and rivers will run clear and free from pollution and, I will give you my recommendations for the implementation of that  goal.  Those  recommendations  will  emphasize  the  state’s  role  as  a  coordinator  of  local  efforts  and  as  a seeker of citizen cooperation. I have spoken particularly to this point of those programs and public efforts where the level of funding very largely defines capacity  to  serve. My budget message  several weeks  from now will be  far more comprehensive in presenting recommendations for your decisions regarding spending. Let  us  now  turn  to  the  consideration  of  areas  in  which  fundamental  changes  in  policy  and  structure  are required. Vermonters  are  justifiably  deeply  concerned  about  the  increasing  impact  upon  their  lives  of  the  cost  of public utility services. There is no amount of state funding which will address itself to these concerns. It should be  clear  to  all  by  now  that  the  concept,  structure,  and  operations  of  the  public  service  board,  established many decades  ago  to  deal  with  problems  of  that  time,  fall  far  short  of  the  capacity  to  address  themselves  to  present problems. I  will  propose  legislation  to  separate  the  planning,  regulatory  and  judicial  functions  now  handled  by  the public  service  board,  in  order  to  provide  adequate  planning  and  oversight  of  our  public  utilities  and  more objective consideration of both immediate and long-term public interests. Vermont can provide an example of energy conservation. State government must and will lead the way. We must initiate tangible projects which demonstrate that our forests can provide us with a source of energy without harming  the  environment.  We  must  provide  incentives  to  industry  and  to  private  consumers  to  conserve, including such items as differential automobile registration fees which are based on energy efficiency. * * * No  government  can  succeed  if  its  people  do  not  have  confidence  in  it,  nor  can  they  be  expected  to  have confidence  unless  the  lines  of  communications  between  the  citizenry  and  the  government  are  open  and accessible. The  so-called  “governor’s  action  line”  has  opened  communications between  thousands  of Vermonters  each year and their government and I believe is a foundation which should be built upon. I shall propose for your consideration the creation of an office of public advocacy and research to be headed by  an  ombudsman who  should  have  full  cabinet  rank  to  assure  all  citizens  that  their  problems with  any  branch of state government will be given friendly, thoughtful, and objective attention. * * * In  recent  weeks  I  have  become  increasingly  concerned  over  the  lack  of  trained  women  in  middle management  positions  in  state  government.  Without  a  positive  effort  to  overcome  this  injustice,  this  situation will continue and will also continue to prevent the placement of qualified women in positions of top leadership. I intend to provide career opportunities for women in government through active pursuit of an affirmative action program. Vermont  needs  the  talents  and  skills  of  its women,  as well  as  of  its men,  and must make  a  concerted effort to bring this about. * * * Now I come to a portion of this message which I believe to be of great importance and significance because it bears directly on the purpose and role of government. Beyond  funding  of  ongoing  needs  and  even  beyond  changes  in  structure  and  circumstances  there  are  three vital  areas  that  require  critical  examination  and  decisive  action.  They  are  these:  federal,  state  and  local interaction,  the  effective  management  of  the  operating  side  of  government,  and  the  relationship  between  state government and its employees. Vermont must  seek a new  relationship with  the  federal government, establishing her own authority  in  those areas where the rights and responsibilities of Vermont citizens must be sovereign. Increasingly  we  find  our  scope  of  action  defined  by  the  structures  and  mandates  of  federal  programs  to which we  have  subscribed. Where  programs  and  grants  call  upon  us  to  enter  into  an  area which we would  not have chosen to enter at our own expense, we must be increasingly willing to decline participation. We  must  also  be  more  aggressive  in  presenting  our  positions  as  the  federal  administration  develops regulations to implement the intent of federal legislation. Of even greater concern, however, appears a relatively new  inclination of  the  federal government  to  require the  states  to  take  actions  at  great  expense  for  which  the  federal  government  itself  makes  no  provisions  for funding. We  must  address  ourselves  to  the  issue  posed  by  these  and  other  similar  federal  demands  which  have  the potential to destroy the effective and responsible  implementation of Vermont’s own programs designed  to meet its own needs. We should also remember that our own state government has an equal capability to needlessly interfere with the appropriate self-determination of the cities and towns of Vermont. We must strongly reaffirm  the proposition  that  the people will be better served when decisions are made by that unit of government closest to them and over which they have the greatest control. * * * If  there  is  one  area  which  demands  attention  in  this  biennium,  it  is  that  which  deals  with  the  relationship between those of us in government and the people we serve, Neither appropriations, nor legislation will succeed, unless the citizens are satisfied with the attitude and the competence of government. To  restore  the  people’s  faith  in  government,  all  of  the  elected  and  employed  representatives  of  government must make it clear in their every contact with the citizenry that they know their job is service. Regulations must be administered with an intent to make possible the achievement of the valid goals of the citizens. To this spirit, to  this  attitude,  to  this  determination  to  show  the  citizens  of  Vermont  that  we  are  all  their  servants,  I  pledge myself and convey the like pledges of those who will serve in appointed positions within this administration.    * * * Year  after  year,  demands  for  the  services  of  government  have  increased,  as  have  taxes—far  more  rapidly than  the  income  of  the  citizens  who  support  government.  Tax  burdens  have  become  a  critical  element determining the standard of living of tens of thousands of working Vermonters. If  we  are  not  to  turn  away  from  essential  needs  in  the  face  of  injunction  which  wisdom  places  upon  our authority  to  increase  taxes,  we  must  give  thoughtful  and  imaginative  attention  to  how  we  operate  government and each program. Although  this  responsibility  rests  clearly  with  the  executive  branch,  we  can  learn  much  from  the  private sector about how to do jobs well but without waste. Work  is already well advanced  to establish  a governor’s  cost  control  council  financed  totally by  the private sector, which I believe has great capacity to help us do our jobs better. The  work  of  government  is  not  done  by  dollars,  nor  is  it  done  by  governors,  or  their  appointees.  Though much  can  be  accomplished  by  competent  and  knowledgeable  leadership.  In  the  end  it  is  the  ability,  the motivation,  the  understanding,  and  the  good  will  of  thousands  of  state  employees  which  actually  determines how well the people are served. * * * I find no single area in which I believe the government of the state of Vermont to be in greater disrepair than that  which  defines  the  relationship  between  the  state  and  its  employees.  I  believe  that  for  too  long  we  have assumed  that  because  state  employees  are  engaged  to  serve  us,  we  were  entitled  to  treat  them  as  though  they were  in  servitude. We  have  not  provided  them with  incomes  comparable  to  those  available  to  their  friends  and neighbors in private industry—we have not provided them with incentives for higher productivity—we have not given  them  clear  goals.  We  have  not  shown  them  that  dedicated  service  can  lead  to  advancement  within  the ranks. Despite  these omissions on our part,  there  are many dedicated  and highly  competent  individuals  still  in our employ. They are there, of course, because their desire to do a job exceeds their insistence upon the relationship usually  to be  found between a good employer and a good employee. It  is clear  that we have neither attracted as many qualified citizens  to government employ as we ought  to have, nor have we always maintained  the best of those who have come to serve. I believe  it  is quite possible  that with better selection, compensation and  leadership,  the number of men and women now employed by the state of Vermont might possibly have rendered all of the services requested by all of those who sought additional funding for the next biennium. And so  if we do nothing else  in  this session,  let us make sure we have set  in motion a process by which we will  have  moved  toward  a  more  capable  body  of  public  servants  who  will  merit  the  widest  possible  public support. The  achievement  of  this  goal  will  place  very  substantial  responsibilities  on  the  governor,  the  agency secretaries, and the commissioners. But it will require, in addition, broad understanding and authorizations from the legislature to establish the conditions under which we may seek the required progress in this area. I  am  prepared  to  propose  to  you,  on  certain  vital  conditions which  I  shall make  clear  in  a moment,  that  the state  provide  its  employees  with  one  of  the  largest  pay  increases  in  history.  I  am  prepared  to  propose  to  you total compliance with the findings of the compensation review board of an 11.6% adjustment to bring pay up to that  level  considered  presently  comparable  to  wages  in  the  private  sector,  plus  an  additional  5%  to  allow  for inflation from the date of the studies to July 1, 1977. Before  I  can  make  such  a  recommendation,  I  shall  need  to  feel  certain  that  the  employees  and  their representatives  will  assist  us  to  remove  all  barriers  to  the  establishment  of  a  set  of  work  procedures  and standards and opportunities for productivity which will also be comparable to private industry. Not the least of these will be the establishment of a standard straight-time, forty-hour week as is common in the  private  sector.  Further we  shall  need  to  discuss  revision  in  procedures  by which we  seek  out  and  hire  state employees,  systems  by  which  we  advance  and  promote  state  employees,  and  the  procedures  by  which  we  are entitled  to discharge  those  employees who do not  render  service  to  the  state of value  comparable  to  that which they are paid. I shall seek your approval of legislation in two other critical areas to move toward this goal. First, I propose that  the  state  undertake  to  bargain  collectively,  through  open  and  constructive  negotiations  between  employer and employee, all items relating to compensation and economic benefits. I will call on the compensation review board  to  serve  an  important  function  in  that  process,  to  assure  me  that  I  have  the  most  current  and  objective information  relating  to  compensation  and  those  other  elements  which  clearly  bear  on  the  appropriateness  and justice of all elements of the compensation package. I  understand,  of  course,  that  no  governor  can  be  committed  in  advance  to  any  group,  under  any circumstances, to reach any specific agreement as it is my responsibility to recommend for your consideration a course of action appropriately allocating our total capacity against our total needs. I  intend  to utilize  the process of open  and  straight-forward negotiation within  the  constraints  imposed upon me  as  governor  to  achieve  a  responsible,  rewarding,  and  mutually  satisfactory  basis  for  a  strong  employment relationship between the state of Vermont and its loyal and hard-working employees. Secondly,  I  shall  seek  your  support  for  legislation  broadening  the  role  and  the  scope  of  the  personnel department  so  it  may  become  a  department  of  employee  relations  charged  broadly  with  improving  the  morale and  effectiveness  of  state  employees  and  with  providing  services  in  career  counseling  and  with  increasing opportunities for in-service education designed to improve the capacity for service. * * * It  is  clear  to me,  as  it must  be  to  you,  that  in  this  address  I  have  outlined  needs  for  action  and  for  funding which will tax both our stamina and our ability. To strive to do great things is to risk great failures. Perhaps that is  the  inevitable  lot of man  reaching  to  fulfill his  aspirations. But you  and  I have no more  choice  as  to whether or not we make history than did our ancestors. We can only decide what kind of history. The wisdom, good-will and  dedication  so  common  among  those  who  led  Vermont  these  last  200  years  brings  us  the  heritage  we  so cherish. And now we in our turn must act knowing that our successes, and our failures, will become the heritage of  those who will  follow. The  outcome  is  in  our  hands. Let  us  proceed  together  asking God’s  blessings  on  our labors. Thank you. BENEDICTION The Benediction was pronounced by the Most Reverend John A.
