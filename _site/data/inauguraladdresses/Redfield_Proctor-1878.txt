Inaugural address of  Redfield Proctor  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  Joint Assembly  Biennial Session,  1878  Thursday, October 3, 1878 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: We are assembled in accordance with the provisions of the constitution to assume the duties of legislation as representatives of the people.  It is their right and duty to demand of us the utmost fidelity to their interests; and a  just  appreciation  of  the  great  trusts  they  have  placed  in  our  charge must  impress  us with  a  deep  sense  of  our responsibility  to  them,  and  inspire  us  with  the  highest  resolve  to  quit  ourselves  like  men.    In  this  spirit  let  us approach the business of the session. STATE FINANCES. The State is virtually out of debt.  The amounts due the Agricultural College fund and due towns on account of  the  United  States  surplus  fund,  are  not  properly  chargeable  to  liabilities  in  arriving  at  our  present  financial standing.      Omitting  these,  therefore,  there  was  on  the  first  day  of  August,  a  balance  of  $87,934.74  in  the treasury, after providing for unexpended appropriations and for the payment of the last of our war bonds, which mature on the first day of December next. This  is  a  proud  record  for  our  little  State.    In  the  great war  of  the  rebellion,  our  soldiers made  the  name  of Vermont  respected  and  honored,  by  friend  and  foe.    And  now  the  State  has  shown  herself  not  unworthy  to  be the mother  of  such  sons  by  promptly  and  ungrudgingly meeting  the  last  dollar  of  her war  obligations,  and  has illustrated the self-evident truth, that the greatest measure of public faith and honesty goes hand in hand with the truest courage and patriotism. The  following  is  the  statement of  the  treasurer,  showing  the assets and  liabilities of  the State at  the close of the last fiscal year: LIABILITIES.

I  should  regret  to  have  you  draw  any  argument  from  these  facts  in  favor  of  an  increase  of  State  expenses.  However desirable  it may  appear  to make more  liberal  expenditures  for  some of our  public  institutions  and  for many  other  purposes,  the  present  is  not  a  favorable  time  for  such  increase.    Our  towns  are,  most  of  them,  in debt, many of them very heavily, and it is a plain duty, so far as is consistent with the necessary requirements of the State, to relieve the people of State taxation and enable them to pay off their town debts.  The amount of this indebtedness  on  the  third  day  of March,  1868,  exclusive  of  the  United  States  Surplus  Fund  borrowed,  was,  in round numbers, one  and  a half millions, or nearly  the  same as  the  total  amount of State debt  at  the  close of  the war.   On  account  of  heavy  debts  since  contracted  by  towns  in  aid  of  railroads,  the  amount  is  probably  quite  as large  now.    Individual  indebtedness  also  is  large.    The  returns  of  labor,  capital  and  business  enterprise  of  all kinds, are comparatively small.  There are strong signs that we are entering upon an era of low prices the world over.    The  great  improvements  in  machinery  of  all  kinds;  the  opening  of  hitherto  semi-barbarous  countries  to the  influence  of  civilization,  and  the  consequent  stimulus  to  production;  the  advance  in means  and methods  of transportation  and  exchange  of  commodities  between  different  countries;  the  rapid  increase  in  the  general facilities  for  doing  business,  and many  other  signs  all  point  in  this  direction.    Such  a  period  is  one  of  hardship where taxation is high; where public and private extravagance are the rule, where the laws are not ample for the protection of persons  and property, or prompt  and  inexpensive  in  execution.   But under  favorable  conditions,  a period  of  comparatively  low  prices  may  be  one  of  great  prosperity,  stimulating  industry  and  commerce  by opening new markets to the successful competition of cheap production. Heavy  taxation  drives  away  capital,  clogs  the  wheels  of  business,  and  falls  with  severest  weight  on  those least able to bear it.  It not only takes from them directly their proportion under the law, but it increases the cost of articles of consumption so as to levy an indirect tax upon each individual. Recent statistics show that the prices of our farm products, of labor, and most articles that go to make up the cost of  living, do not vary materially  from what  they were  in 1860.   Our population has  increased  less  than  ten per  cent.,  and  our  grand  list  less  than  five,  since  that  time.    Is  there  any  good  reason,  then,  why  our  State expenses should be more than doubled? Let  me  call  your  attention  to  some  facts  from  the  report  of  the  “Joint  Special  Committee,  relating  to  the increase of State expenses,” made at  the  last session, and which you will find  in  the appendix  to  the Journals of both  the House and Senate.   I would ask you  to make careful examination of  that report, and would suggest  the appointment  of  a  committee  at  this  session  on  the  same  subject.    The  figures  give  the  State  expenses  for  the years 1860 and 1876, but a comparison with 1878 would, I fear, be even more unfavorable: 1876 1860        Court Expenses ............................................................................................. |  $65,570.24   |   $133,583.92 Salaries and Expenses of State Officers........................................................ | 5,413.31   |      13,228.13  7,563.58 2,053.07   | Printing.......................................................................................................... | 28,212.02 12,474.17   | Care of Deaf, Dumb, Blind, Insane, etc. ....................................................... | Agriculture .................................................................................................... | 1,832.45   | 2,635.98 15,759.12 2,787.00   | Militia ............................................................................................................ | 17,954.97 6,879.13   | Education ...................................................................................................... | Fish Commissioners ...................................................................................... |   | 751.67 1,749.22 1,420.40   | Library........................................................................................................... |    | | EXPENSES SESSION. 28,328.40   | Debentures of General Assembly ................................................................. | 1,075.00   | Secretaries, Clerks and Reporters ................................................................. | Legislative Printing ....................................................................................... | 6,518.51   | 48,833.00 2,700.50 22,593.86 The Auditor’s  report  for  1878 was  received  too  late  for  careful  examination.   At my  request,  however,  the Auditor  has  furnished  me  the  items  which  show  an  increase  of  court  expenses  in  1878  above  1876  of  over $35,000.00. I  am  assured  that often  the  entire  sum of  the verdicts of  a  term of  court  fall  far  short of  the  expenses of  the term  to  the  State.    No  further  comment  on  court  expenses  is  needed.    I  have  omitted  in  the  foregoing  tables, some  items  of  extraordinary  expenses,  and  other  having  no  bearing  on  the  general  question;  but  the  grant  total gives  the  State  expenses  for  1860,  $142,982.48,  and  for  1876, with  the  expense  of  a  session  of  the Legislature added, $326,726.96; without the session expenses, $244,954.73. Dividing  the  expense  of  a  session,  as  they  are  now  biennial,  and  adding  one-half  to  the  other  expenses  for 1876, gives $285,840.84, or $124.12  less  than  the double expenses of 1860, which  included  the entire expenses of a session. The  State  tax  for  five  years  preceding  the  war  averaged  sixteen  and  one-fifth  per  cent.,  and  this  included large appropriations for building the State House.  I think the State expenses ought to be so reduced that a tax of twenty  cents  will  be  ample,  and  still  do  all  we  are  now  doing,  and  more  if  required,  for  our  public  charities, schools,  and  all  objects  worthy  of  our  attention.    I  do  not  mean  to  say  that  all  of  this  increase  of  expense  is unnecessary,  by  any means.    Some  of  it  is  called  for  by  additional  duties  and  responsibilities  thrown  upon  the various departments; and in other cases it is manifestly just and reasonable.  But quite a part of it has come from the  general  tendency  of  the  time  towards  liberal  expenditures which  has  pervaded  all  public,  as well  as  private affairs.  It would transcend the proper limits of this communication, to attempt discussion of special methods of retrenchment.   The whole matter  is  in your hands, and  the means of any  further  information you may desire, at your command. The  greatest  single  item,  that  of  court  expense,  is  in  my  opinion,  of  sufficient  importance  to  warrant  the attention of a Special Committee to that point alone. I  am  glad  to  refer  with  approval  to  the  discussion  of  the  subject  of  trials  by  jury  and  referees  in  the  first message  of  my  predecessor.    If  parties  were  compelled  to  bear  a  larger  share  of  the  expenses  of  jury  trials,  it might diminish the amount of petty litigation, and lead to more references under the Statute, and do no violence to  the  cause  of  justice.    Possibly,  if  no  satisfactory  remedy  is  found,  it  may  be  advisable  to  appoint  a commissioner,  who  shall  investigate  the  whole  subject  of  court  expenses  and  report  at  the  next  session, recommending such changes of the Statute or Constitution, as the case demands. ASSESSMENT OF TAXES “Every  member  of  society  hath  a  right  to  be  protected  in  the  enjoyment  of  life,  liberty  and  property,  and therefore  is bound  to contribute his proportion  toward  the expense of  that protection.”   To  secure  this  result of equality of  taxation  to  the utmost possible extent,  is  the plain demand of  this clause of  the Constitution which  I have quoted. To rehearse the evils of our present system, or rather, what is worse, of our administration of it, would be to repeat  what  my  predecessors  have  often  said,  and  what  every  citizen  has  seen  and  felt.    Not  the  least  among these  evils  is  the  corrupting  influence  of  constant  evasions  of  law.    You  understand  the  subject  fully,  and  the responsibility for failure to apply a remedy must rest with you.   Several measures have been proposed to secure a  just  and  equal  assessment.    At  the  last  session  a  bill  passed  the  House,  (House  bill  No.  271,)  requiring  each tax-payer  to  swear  to  his  list.    The  laws  of  Massachusetts  and  Connecticut  have  a  similar  provision.    The reduction  of  State  expenses  and  the  direct  payment  of  any  special  taxes  to  the  State  will  so  far,  but  only  to  a limited  extent,  remove  the  object  for  undervaluation  as  between  different  towns,  but  would  have  no  effect  to relieve the inequalities among the tax-payers of the same town. The  law prescribed  that  the  assessment of  the  road-bed of  railroads  shall not  exceed $2,000 per mile.    I  am informed,  that  in  at  least one  case  the  equalizing board  raised  the valuation of  a  town, where  the  listers had  set the  road-bed  at  the  limit  of  $2,000,  and  that  the  railway  company  will  contest  the  validity  of  the  list  on  this ground.  If there is a defect in the statute, it should be remedied. SAVINGS BANKS. These  institutions  are  assuming  important  proportions  in  our  State,  holding  now  over  eight  millions  of deposits.   The  amount  in 1860 was  a  little over one million.   They have been  so well managed,  that during  the last  few  years  of  financial  trouble,  while  some  of  the  neighboring  States  have  suffered  severely  from  the reckless  and  dishonest  management  of  these  institutions,  our  savings  banks  have  all  stood  firm,  and  none  of them  have  suffered  serious  loss.    This  result,  however,  is  due  more  to  the  honesty  and  skill  of  their  direction, than  to  our  legislation.    They  are  all  acting  under  special  charters,  differing  considerably  in  their  provisions.  They are not  to any extent  restricted as  to where  they may make  loans.   All of  them  loan part of  their  funds on mortgage.    Some  of  them  have  made  these  loans  on  real  estate  at  the West.    These,  so  far  as  I  can  learn  have been  carefully  made  and  have  yielded  larger  interest  than  could  have  been  realized  from  other  sources.    The fundamental  idea  of  a  savings  bank  is  absolute  safety,  though  at  some  sacrifice  of  interest  and  dividends.    It seems  to me  unwise  and  unsafe  to  lose  sight  of  this  in  our  legislation.   We  cannot  always  depend  upon  having honest and capable men in charge; and even such men, unless restricted by law, will be more liable to mistakes.  We  know  what  wide-spread  disaster  the  failure  or  even  suspension  of  a  savings  bank  would,  cause  in  its vicinity,  and  among  a  class who  have  earned  their money  by  years  of  hard  labor  and  close  economy,  and who would all the more keenly feel its loss. I recommend a general law placing all savings banks under the same general provisions and restrictions, and repealing  so  much  of  their  special  charters  as  conflicts  therewith,  but  requiring  no  change  of  investments already  made.    Then  in  granting  future  charters  little  would  be  necessary  except  to  name  the  bank,  its corporators and location, – referring to the general law for its rights and duties.  This policy of a general organic law  is  being  adopted  by  other  States,  and  I  would  refer  you  among  others  to  the  new  law  of  Massachusetts, passed  at  the  session  of  1876,  also  to  the  law  of  New  York  of  1875,  both  of  which  embrace  some  wise provisions, which the costly experience of those States had shown to be necessary. Such  legislation  would  ensure  uniformity  and  the  greatest  measure  of  safety,  for  if  the  general  law  were found  to  be  defective,  it  would  be  corrected;  but  few  look  for  defects  in  a  special  charter  unless  to  take advantage of them. Some  charters  have  no  restrictions  upon  investments,  except  that  “the  deposits  shall  be  used  and  improved to the best advantage.” I will  not  express  an  opinion  as  to whether  a  general  law  should  allow  loans  on Western mortgages;  but  if they are permitted, the banks should be required to report the amount of such loans separately from home loans on mortgages,  so  that  depositors  could  know  precisely  the  nature  of  their  investments.    Of  course  in  case  of  a panic  or  run  upon  a  bank, money  could  not  be  realized  upon  these  remote mortgages  as  readily  as  upon  home loans,  nor  would  any  showing  in  regard  to  them  pacify  importunate  depositors  like  an  exhibit  of  securities  in their own neighborhood, which they would know, or could readily learn all about. Any  laws  you  may  see  fit  to  enact  in  regard  to  savings  banks  should  be  carefully  considered,  and  with  a view  to promote and extend  their usefulness, and  to strengthen  the public confidence,  to which  they are now so well entitled by their honest and judicious management. The  inspector  of  finance  seems  to  have made  a  thorough  examination  of  these  institutions.   He  reports  that in  a  few  instances directors of national banks  are  trustees of  savings banks,  in violation of  section  thirty-seven, chapter eighty-six, General Statutes, and that some banks have exceeded the law in the character and location of some  of  their  investments,  or  in  loaning  to  their  officers.    It  is  not  probable  that  any  of  these  violations  have been with wrong  intent, and no  loss, so  far as known, has  resulted  from  them, but  they ought not  to be allowed to continue, and I have requested the inspector, if they are still in violation, to report the facts in each case. The  inspector  recommends a direct  tax of not more  than one-half of one per  cent. on deposits,  in  lieu of all other  taxation.   This  is  in  accordance with  the  system commonly,  if not universally,  adopted  in other States.    It is  a  matter  for  your  careful  consideration,  and  I  commend  the  remarks  of  the  inspector  on  the  evils  of  the present system to your attention. SPECIAL LEGISLATION It may,  at  first  view,  seem  unimportant  in  our  state  to  object  to  this  class  of  legislation,  but  it  is  only  by  a stern  exclusion  of  every minor  evil  that we  can  attain  to  the  symmetrical whole  of  a well  regulated State.    It  is our  plain  duty  and  no  injustice  to  our  constituents,  where  the  objects  they  seek  can  be  obtained  under  the general law, to require them to use it. The mere  habit  of  listening  to  the  appeals  of  private  interests  is  a  pernicious  one  in  legislation.   Where  the immediate case carries no direct harm with it, it may still be an entering wedge, or precedent for what will prove a  positive  wrong.   We  have  a  general  railroad  law.    If  this  is  not  ample  for  the  promotion  of  every  legitimate enterprise,  let us make  it so.   We have a general enabling act allowing  towns  to aid  in  the building of  railroads.  If this is to remain the settled policy of the State, is it not the part of wisdom and prudence to fix upon the limit to  which  this  aid  may  be  granted,  and  then  adhere  to  it?    We  have  also  general  laws  for  the  organization  of corporations,  changing  names,  and  the  like,  to  which  those  asking  private  acts  for  these  purposes  can  be referred, and if the general law is inadequate, its provision can be extended.   We have already made progress in this matter.   Compare  the  Session Laws  of  1872,  1874,  and  1876.   The  latter  year-book  has  only  207  pages  of private  acts  against  481  in  the  former,  or  less  than  one-half.    At  the  session  of  1874  over  fifty  bills  of  this character  were  rejected,  which  if  passed,  as  had  been  the  previous  custom,  would  have  made  the  volume  as large as that of 1872.  The mere cost to the State of printing this private matter is no inconsiderable item. As an example of how readily improper provisions in special acts escape notice in their passage through the Legislature,  I will cite one act passed at  the  last session.   Three savings banks were  incorporated, and all of  the charters  contained  the  same  restrictions  as  to  the  investment  of  their  funds,  substantially  as  follows:    “All deposits  shall  be  managed  and  improved  by  loaning  on  mortgages  of  real  estate,  except  to  an  amount  not exceeding  one-half  the  amount  on  deposit,  which  said  sum  may  be  invested  in  the  purchase  of  stocks  of  the United States,  or  any  of  them  in  bank  stock  of  any  bank  in  this State,  or  in  any  city  or  town  bonds  of  the New England  States,  or  in  undoubted  personal  security.”    But  in  one  of  these  acts  the  words  “or  otherwise  as  the trustees shall direct” are added, thus destroying entirely the force of the limitation. Governor Peck, whose judicial training enables him to detect, at a glance, an improper provision, sent to the House  during  the  one  session  of  his  administration  four  veto  messages  –  all  upon  acts  of  incorporation.    The people of Illinois found it necessary in 1870 to forbid, by constitutional provision, all ordinary classes of special legislation,  and  to  declare  that  “where  a  general  law  can  be made  applicable,  no  special  law  shall  be  enacted.”  New York and Pennsylvania have since followed this example. Every man who has a conscientious regard for pure and safe legislation would regret to see us take any step backward in this matter, and there is still room for progress in the right direction. STATE REFORM SCHOOL The  good management  and  general  success  of  this  institution  are  so well  known  to  the  people  of  the  State, that  no  special  mention  is  needed.    The  land  (about  130  acres)  is  of  excellent  quality,  but  was  not  in  good condition when purchased.   Much has been done,  and  is being done,  to  improve  it,  the boys doing all  the  labor under  the  direction  of  the  farmer.    I  think,  however,  still  more  of  the  boys’  labor  might  be  employed  in improving and bringing  it  to a high  state of cultivation.   The  labor yields but  little  (about  fifteen cents per day) on  the  work  of  seating  chairs,  and  it  would  be  economy  for  the  State  to make  the  farm  a model  of  cultivation and production.   No  industry will exert so good an  influence upon  the wards of  the State morally, mentally and physically as farm labor.  None will stand them in so good stead in after life. The  Superintendent  has  frequently  asked  that  machinery  be  introduced  to  carry  on  some  complete manufacture.    This would  be much  better  for  the  boys,  as  it would  teach  them  some  trade,  and  ought  to  prove more  profitable  for  the  State.    But  a mistake  in  this  direction would  prove  expensive,  and  before  any  action  is taken  the  matter  should  be  thoroughly  investigated  by  sagacious  business  men,  acquainted  with  various industries, who will gather the experience of similar institutions in other States, and present facts and figures, on which  the State  can  act understandingly.   More  room  for  the boys’ department  is  asked  for.   An  appropriations was made two years ago for a new barn, and also to afford the additional room required for the boys raising the roof  of  the  old  gun-house.    But,  I  understand,  that  after  building  the  barn,  the  amount  remaining  was  not sufficient for the contemplated changes, and was used for enlarging the house occupied by the girls.  Additional room  for  the  boys  would  certainly  be  desirable  if  the  number  is  to  continue  as  large  as  at  present.   Whenever made,  it would be  true economy  to do  the work  in a  substantial manner, with due  reference  to  safety  from  fire, and  to  have  plans  submitted,  with  bids  for  the  material  and  construction  complete,  before  making  the appropriation. The Superintendent reports the cost for the past year at $117.29 per capita, which figures compare favorably with those of similar institutions in other States. STATE PRISON The reports of the Directors and other officers will show you in detail the affairs of this institution. The  officers  seem  to  have  discharged  their  duties  faithfully.    The Directors  ask  for  an  addition  to  the main building; and it is true there is not sufficient cell room for the prisoners now there.   A new wing was built three years since, which was designed  to be  large enough  to give all  the  room  that would be  required  for many years to come. The number of prisoners has increased rapidly in the last four years, –in 1874 it was 85; in 1876, 117, and in 1878, 176.  We are no worse off than other States in this respect, as the prison statistics of the country show that the number of convicts  in  the higher prisons has nearly doubled  in  the  last six years.   We may,  then, with some reason hope that the time is an exceptional one, and look with a revival of business for a decrease of crime.  The Directors,  in  1872  and  1874,  in  their  reports  oppose  the  policy  of  sentencing  convicts  for  minor  offenses  and short terms to the prison, and their view is obviously correct. The work house has seventy-eight cells for males, and might keep some more in less secure quarters – about one  hundred  in  all.    This  will  relieve  the  prison  somewhat,  and  if  there  is  no  increase  in  crime,  perhaps sufficiently. The  prison  grounds  embrace  about  three  acres  of  land,  and  a  large  part  of  this  is  covered  by  the  buildings.  From  their  location  and  arrangement  with  reference  to  each  other,  any  plan  for  an  addition  needs  to  be  very carefully matured,  and with  the greatest possible  foresight  as  to  the probable  future  policy  and  requirements  of the State, with reference to the prison. In  this  connection,  and  at  the  risk  of  being  charged with  trenching  upon  ground  outside my  proper  limits,  I must  refer  to  the  pernicious  and  growing  custom  of  filling  many  State  offices,  and  especially  those  having charge  of  these  State  institutions,  from  among  the  members  of  the  General  Assembly.    Such  choice  is  wisely forbidden  by  the  constitutions  of  some  States.   The  evils which  result  from  this  course  here  during  the  session can  be  readily  understood  and  appreciated without mention,  and  I will  refer  only  to  those  lesser  ones  affecting the institutions themselves and the expense of supporting them.  They are great business enterprises, costing the State  a  large  sum  yearly,  and  should  be  conducted  in  a  business  way.   We  need  in  their  management  the  best judgment, technical knowledge and experience that the whole State affords, and to fill these offices in any other way  is  an  expensive  mistake.    They  are,  however,  too  often  distributed  as  personal  or  political  rewards.    We sometimes change all  the officers at  the same  time.   Every new set of officers wish  to mark  their  term of office by some departure from the course of their predecessors. A  wiser  system  would  secure  greater  economy,  better  discipline,  and  a  more  permanent  and  continuing policy in our administration of these institutions. WORKHOUSE The site selected by the Commissioners contains eight acres, and is in every way adapted to the purpose. The  act  of  1876  required  that  persons  convicted  of  certain  offenses  after  September  1,  1878,  should  be sentenced to the workhouse.  The cells are not dry enough for use, and are not likely to be until about the first of December next. The  courts  are  in  session  in  several  counties,  and  I  would  recommend  an  immediate  change  of  the  law, whereby such sentences may be imposed as can be carried out. I  would  also  recommend  that  a  careful  examination  of  the  laws  be  made,  to  see  what,  if  any,  changes  are necessary to adapt them to the new workhouse system. A small appropriation will be  required  for  furnishing  the workhouse.   The general aims and purposes of  the workhouse  system  are  deserving  of  all  commendation;  and  I  believe  this  our  first  trial  of  it,  if  well  managed, will give beneficent results in the diminution of crime and save expense to the State. THE PARDONING POWER. The Constitution vests  this  entirely with  the Governor.   Under  the old  theory  of  the  divine  right  of  kings,  a crime was an offense against the King alone – the Sovereign – and he alone, of course, could pardon.  It was an act of personal grace and forgiveness, and an essential prerogative of kingly power. From  this  source  it  has  come  to  us;  but  in  my  view,  the  changes  conditions  necessarily  change  the  whole theory  of  it.    Under  our  form  of  government  the  people  are  sovereign.    The  crime  is  committed  against  them, and  a  pardon  can  only  properly  be  granted,  as  an  act  of  justice  on  their  part,  to  the  criminal,  and  with  all  the safeguards which surround judicial proceedings.  It is a reversal of the judgment of the courts, and should never be granted to defeat the intention of the law, but to give it effect:  as where new evidence comes to light, which if produced at the trial would have changed the verdict or sentence; or where the law, by reason of its generality or imperfections, reaches cases which would have been excepted if foreseen. The  free  exercise  of  this  power  encourages  crime  by  robbing  punishment  of  its  terror.   The  certainty  that  a just  measure  of  punishment  will  follow  conviction  is  necessary  to  inspire  transgressors  with  a  wholesome respect for law. Most of the State now modify, and regulate the pardoning power of the Governor, in some way; associating others  with  him  in  its  exercise,  requiring  public  notice  of  such  applications,  the  opinion  of  the  court  that sentenced  the  criminal,  and  other  provisions  calculated  to  give  the  proceedings  the  weight,  publicity,  and freedom  from  all  suspicion  of  weakness  or  undue  influence  which  characterize  a  judicial  decision.    Such provisions,  too, would give  a healthier  tone  to public  feeling  in  regard  to  criminals,  and do  away with much of the sentimental philanthropy so often displayed. Calling  your  attention  to  the  excellent  remarks  of my  predecessor  on  this  subject,  in  his  closing message,  I submit to you the question, whether it is not the part of wisdom to regulate the method of the Executive exercise of  this power, so  far as you can under  the Constitution.   This course may  inaugurate some better system, which can be hereafter engrafted upon the Constitution, with such modification as experience may dictate. INSANE ASYLUM The  Commissioner  says,  in  commencing  his  report,  that  he  has  not  complied  with  the  law,  and  that  it  is impossible  to  do  so,  “without  you  pay  your  own  expenses.”    The  pay  has  not  been  reduced,  nor  the  duties increased,  since he  accepted  the office.   He  seems  to have made  full  report  of many matters of detail. Some of his  suggestions  are  very  sensible,  and  worthy  of  attention.    I  must,  however,  differ  with  him  in  his recommendation  to enlarge  the duties of  the Commissioner, by giving him  the oversight of all  the  insane  in  the State.    It  would,  in  my  view,  be  creating  a  roving  commission,  with  powers  and  duties  which,  if  warrantable, can be better entrusted to local authorities, and one the ultimate expenses of which we cannot estimate. I  call  your  attention  to  the  increase  in  the  number  of  “public”  patients,  and  consequent  increase  of  expense to the State, as given in the report of the trustees.  The number was 233 in 1871-2, and 295 now, while there has been  a  corresponding  decrease  in  the  “private”  class  from  273  at  the  former  period  to  164  at  the  present  time.  These figures are certainly suggestive, and I recommend a careful examination of the subject of State aid to see if  its  privileges  are  not  abused.    It  is  in  accordance with  our  general  policy,  and manifestly  the  part  of wisdom not to assume duties and obligations which can be properly left with the towns. The  commission  appointed  by Governor  Fairbanks  not  having  yet made  their  report,  I will  not  at  this  time make any suggestions upon matters likely to receive their attention. EDUCATION I  am glad  to  call your  attention  to  the  able  report of  the Superintendent.   The weight of authority which his experience  gives  him,  as well  as  the  importance  of  the  subject,  should  insure  a  careful  consideration  of  the  ten specific  recommendations  which  he  makes.    The  third  seems  to  be  a  proper  safeguard  against  unlawful payments  of  public money.   Whether  the  fifth,  sixth  and  sevenths would produce  in  all  localities  the  beneficial results  sought  for  may  admit  of  question.    Whatever  action  you  may  take  on  the  subject  of  education,  it  is desirable to give, as much as possible, a character of permanency to our policy. DIVORCE I call your attention to the Statutes regulating divorce.  The family relation is an institution upon which rests the moral  and  political wellbeing  of  a  people,  and  should  be  stable  and  permanent  in  its  character.   Under  our present Statutes, a party who claims to have suffered by a breach of the marriage covenant in other governments or  in  distant  States, may  come  into  this  State  and,  after  a  brief  sojourn,  sue  for  a  divorce;  and  often  causes  for divorce are alleged which would be unavailing in the jurisdiction where they occurred. I  commend  this  subject  to your  careful  consideration,  and  submit  to your  judgment whether  the  interests of the  people  would  not  be  subserved  by  making  the  marriage  covenant  indissoluble  except  for  those  grave  and flagrant  crimes  which  necessarily  put  an  end  to  the  sanctity  and  purity  of  the  marriage  relation.    Whether  a decree of  separation  should not be granted  for  sufficient  causes, which  should  regulate  the  custody  of  children and  the  apportionment  of  property;  and  whether  a  longer  residence  should  not  be  required,  and  greater safeguards provided against fraudulent divorces. AGRICULTURE I  should  speak  of  our  agricultural  interests,  and  the  operations  of  the  board,  if  time  permitted,  but  your understanding of the whole subject is so complete as to render it unnecessary. MILTIA The  militia  force  of  the  State  consists  of  one  regiment  of  infantry  and  one  battery  of  artillery,  the  units  of organization  of  these  arms  of  the  service.    The  force  is  in  a  high  state  of  efficiency  in  every  respect,  and  there can be no question that the interest of the State require that it be kept so.  Besides the necessity for a small force in  every  State,  we  owe  some  duty  to  the  general  government,  which  has  contributed  so  liberally  arms  and munitions, to hold ourselves in readiness to respond to her call if required.  The State bears in reality but a small part of  the  expense.   The heavy  share  falls upon  the members  themselves,  and much has been borne by private contributions, or has come from other sources than taxation. REVISION OF THE STATUTES The  question  of  a  revision  of  the  Statutes will,  no  doubt,  come  before  you.    They  are  now much  scattered, and  to bring  them  together without  revision, would make a book altogether  too unwieldy.   The work cannot be long postponed, and it may be well to provide for it at the present session. UNITED STATES SENATOR The national  law  requires  that you proceed on  the second Tuesday of  the session  to  the election of a United States  Senator,  for  six  years  from  the  fourth  day  of March  next,  at which  time  the  term  of  one  of  our  senators expires. NATIONAL AFFAIRS The earnest efforts of our national executive to remove the civil service from the arena of politics; to secure a  better  administration  of  the  business  affairs  of  the  nation;  to  establish  a  higher  sense  of  official  duty,  and  to insure  the  same  standard  of  conduct  in  public  which  governs  men  in  private  life,  must  be  productive  of  much good.   This course cannot  fail  to accomplish great direct  results;  to exert a  salutary  influence upon all  state and municipal governments, and to give a healthier tone to the whole political atmosphere.  In support and approval of such beneficent measures, all true lovers of their county can heartily unite. The sons of Vermont rallied to the defense of the nation in her hour of need.  We thought the country worth preserving  at  any  cost  of  life  and  treasure.    The  lives were  freely  given,  and  now we  shall  not  shrink  from  the full  discharge  of  every  other  obligation.    Vermont  will  not  lower  her  standard  of  honor,  nor  under  a  delusive hope for present ease, sacrifice future financial stability. The  present  state  of  affairs  is  the  necessary  result  of  the  war  with  its  attendant  inflation  and  extravagance.  The doctrine that a return to the causes of our present ills, will cure them, needs no refutation.  There is no other remedy  but  retrenchment  and  rigid  economy  in  national,  State, municipal  and  individual  expenses.    But  it  is  a mistake to suppose that the evils of hard times fall upon any one class or condition of men, and pass by others. Let  no  man,  then,  seek  to  build  up  class  distinctions  which  have  no  real  foundation,  or  to  excite  a  fancied conflict of  interests.   I say  fancied, for no real one exists, or can exist among us.   It  is a  time above all others  to learn  the  lesson  of  our mutual  dependence.   We  cannot  legislate  universal  prosperity,  though  unwise  laws may greatly  retard  its  coming.   Honest  labor,  and  that”  firm  adherence  to  justice, moderation,  temperance,  industry and frugality,” which our State constitution enjoins, are the best remedies for the evils of the hour. Our  gratitude  for  the  continued  blessings  of  health within  our  own  borders  is  tempered with  sorrow  for  the affliction of our  fellow men  at  the South.   We  have  differed with  them  in  the past.   We have  felt  their  prowess on many a hard fought field, and returned blow for blow.  We see them now in their present fearful trial display a  fortitude  and  devotion  which  command  our  admiration  and  enlist  our  sympathy.    They  are  our  countrymen.  No  matter  now  what  our  past  strifes  have  been,  the  more  earnest  we  were  in  contention,  the  quicker  and stronger will the manly heart be touched at their calamity, and the more promptly come to their relief.  Let them receive  our  deep  sympathy  and  such  continued  material  aid  as  they  may  need,  and  let  our  petition  join  with theirs that the deadly march of the pestilence may be staid. IN CONCLUSION. Gentlemen, let me earnestly request you to prepare an introduce your measures early, in order that they may be  properly matured.    In  the  hurrying  hours  at  the  close  of  a  session  there  is  no  opportunity  for  this,  and many measures fail for want of time to consider and perfect them.  The growing evil of frequent adjournments for two or three days is every way reprehensible.  It not only costs the State a large sum in the direct loss of time, but it distracts  attention  and  breaks  up  the  current  of  business.    The  same  faithful  attention  to  our  duties  here  which we  should give  to our  affairs  at home or  require  from  those  in our  employ,  is  the only  rule  to  apply.   Avoiding then, every unnecessary delay,  let us exercise a diligent  spirit  in  the dispatch of business, and at  the  same  time, shun that undue haste so dangerous in legislation. And  in  all  our  efforts  let  us  reverently  acknowledge  our  dependence  upon  the  Supreme  Author  of  all  law, and seeks His guidance, that the result of our deliberations may accord with the immutable principles which He has laid down, without which our labors will be in vain. } EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, Montpelier, Vt., Oct. 3, 1878.
