Inaugural address of  Julius Converse  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  House of Representatives  Biennial Session  1872  Friday, October 3, 1872 Inaugural Address  To the Hon. Senate and House of Representatives, constituting the General Assembly of the State of Vermont: After  a vacation of  two years we  are  again  assembled,  agreeably  to  the  requirements of  the Constitution,  to deliberate  with  reference  to  the  welfare  of  our  beloved  State,  and  to  adopt  such  measures,  within  our constitutional authority, as in our best judgment will promote such welfare. The  two  last  years  have  been  characterized,  in  a  marked  degree,  with  the  blessings  of  a  kind  Providence.  Peace  and  quiet  have  reigned  throughout  our  borders.    An  unusual  measure  of  health  has  prevailed.  Unsurpassed  prosperity  has  attended  our  people,  and  crowned  their  industries  with  success.    The  earth  has yielded  her  harvests  in  abundance.    Moral,  religious  and  educational  privileges  and  advantages  have  been continued  to us.   The various departments of our government,  filled,  it  is believed, with  competent  and  faithful public  servants, have  steadily and quietly moved along  in  their  respective  spheres, performing  their duties with diligence, ability and fidelity. STATE FINANCES. I congratulate my fellow citizens on the favorable and highly encouraging condition of our financial affairs, as presented  in  the Treasurer’s Report,  to which  I  respectfully  invite your attention, an  abstract of which  I here insert.   Under  the wise policy adopted by previous Legislatures, and carried out with  scrupulous  fidelity by our accomplished and faithful Treasurer, it seems that the time is not far distant when the public debt will be wholly paid and extinguished, and that, too, without any severe burden upon the people. The Treasurer credits the State as follows for 1871: Balances, Sept. 1, 1870 Bonds in Treasury, Sinking Fund, Cash,  Recd. For Military Stores, by Qr. M.

TREASURER’S ACCOUNT, 1872.

AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE FUND. This Fund is all invested in the Registered Loan of this State, and amounts to the sum of $135,500, on which the  interest  for  the  year,  amounting  to  $8,130,  has  been  credited  to  account  of  income  of  the  Fund.

However  desirable  it  may  be  to  discharge  our  entire  debt,  and  however  compatible  with  the  economical habits  of  the  people  to  be  and  remain  free  from  a  public  debt,  it  seems  to  be  very  doubtful  economy  to  burden ourselves with  onorous  taxes  for  the  sake  of  purchasing  our  bonds  at  a  large  premium, which  have  only  a  few years longer to run.  It seems to me specially improper, in view of the fact that many towns in the State are still indebted  to  considerable  amounts,  and  therefor  liable  to  heavy  taxation,  for  debts  contracted  in  furnishing men and other means for suppressing the late rebellion, and for repairing damages by floods, fires, etc. The  redistribution  of  the  United  States  Deposit  money,  made  necessary  by  the  census  of  1870,  under  the provision of  the statute was effected  in a very satisfactory manner by  the Treasurer.   That officer  in November, 1871,  collected  of  one  hundred  and  eighty  towns  and  gores  the  sum  of  $50,023.17,  and  disbursed  the  same  to sixty-eight towns and cities. It  is  apparent  that  the  burdens  of  taxation  are  still  quite  unequally  distributed.    Is  further  legislation necessary to remedy the evil, or is it chargeable to the improper, unfaithful, or imperfect execution of the laws?  The subject is worthy of the serious consideration of the General Assembly. EDUCATION. The  cause  of  Education will  ever  claim  of  the General Assembly  a most  careful  and watchful  attention.    It requires  no  argument  to  convince  an  intelligent Vermonter,  that  it  is  poor  economy  to withhold  from  any  class of our citizens, and especially the youth, the means of acquiring knowledge, whatever reasonable expenditure of money  is  thereby  made  necessary.    On  this  important  subject  I  can  not  better  express  my  views  than  in  the language of my distinguished predecessor,  in his message  to  the General Assembly, October 1870, and which  I take leave to again present to your consideration: “There  is  a  growing  interest  in  our  public  schools,  and  the  truth  is  generally  acknowledged  that  the education  of  the  people  is  an  indispensable  safeguard  to  the  preservation  of  free  government.    For  the  general diffusion  of  education,  reliance  must  be  had,  primarily,  upon  free  common  schools.    It  is,  therefore,  of  vital importance  to  the  welfare  of  the  State,  that  the  instructions  afforded  in  these  schools  should  be  of  the  highest character attainable.” “Experiment  in  all  the  States  foremost  in  the  cause  of  education,  has  proved  the  great  value  of  Normal Schools in training teachers of common schools.  Good teachers are indispensable, and the Normal School is the instrumentality which can be employed to secure the needed supply.  I venture to suggest that the time has come for the adoption in this State of a more settled and effectual policy on this subject.” In  corroboration  of  the  views  above  expressed,  I  earnestly  recommend  to  your  favorable  consideration  the report of the Board of Education, and the suggestions therein made, confirmed as they are by the suggestions of the Secretary of that Board.  It is believed these suggestions meet a hearty response from teachers, and all others who  have  given  the  subject  a  careful  examination.    Whatever  necessary  increase  of  appropriations  may  be required for the carrying out of the above views and suggestions, will readily be granted, I doubt not. It  is  believed  the  Act  of  November  23,  1870,  No.  12,  Session  Laws,  has  received  little  attention  from  the towns  in  the  State.    I would  respectfully  refer  the General Assembly  to  the  Reports  of  the  Board  of  Education for 1869 and 1870, recommending the enactment of such a law. I  would  suggested  the  propriety  of  allowing  the  system  therein  provided  for  to  be  fairly  and  satisfactorily tested, with such modifications, if any, as appear to be necessary or desirable. It  seems  to  have  engaged  the  attention  of  many  considerate  and  reflecting  men  in  the  State,  and  to  have become  their  settled  conviction,  that  military  service,  in  its  various  departments,  should  in  some  measure  be connected  with  and  become  a  part  of  the  education  of  our  young  men,  and  with  a  view  to  this  end  the institutions in this State in which this science is taught, should receive more liberal pecuniary aid from the State.  I would respectfully ask your candid attention to the subject, and take the liberty to refer to the published report of  the  doings  of  the  National  Agricultural  Convention,  held  at  the  city  of Washington  in  February  last,  where the subject is much discussed. STATE INSTITUTIONS AND CHARITIES. I am happy to see that by the reports of the officers of the State Prison, it appears that the financial condition of that institution is greatly improved, and the prospect is favorable for a still greater improvement hereafter.  It is believed the duties of the several officers have been well and faithfully performed.  I respectfully recommend an appropriation, out of  the surplus earnings of  the prisoners, for  the purpose of fitting up a convenient room  in one of the unused work-shops, to be used for a chapel for the prisoners on Sundays, and other occasions. The  Reform  School,  I  take  pleasure  in  saying,  commends  itself  more  and  more  to  public  favor.    It  is believed  to  be  one  of  the  most  valuable  of  charitable  institutions.    Under  its  excellent  management  it  is accomplishing  incalculable  good.    For  a  full  statement  of  its  present  condition  in  all  its  varied  interests,  I  refer you to the reports of the officers having charge of those interests. The encouragement and promotion of  the great agricultural and manufacturing  interests of  the State  in  their diversified  ramifications, will not be overlooked by  the General Assembly,  if within  the  range of constitutional and reasonable legislation. That  the  immense  water  power  afforded  by  our  numerous  streams  should  be  employed  in  some  profitable industries,  must  be  apparent  to  all.    In  this  connection  I  refer  the  General  Assembly  to  the  first  Report  of  the Board of Agriculture, Manufactures and Mining, for interesting and valuable information. The Asylum for the Insane should ever be watched with a vigilant and scrutinizing eye.  Is it not to be feared that  the  institution  at  Brattleboro  is  wanting  in  some  respects  in  those  accommodations  and  appliances necessary for the health and proper care and treatment of the unfortunate class confined there? I respectfully and earnestly call the attention of the General Assembly to the Report of the Commissioner and his suggestions.  On this important subject, I am persuaded no member of the General Assembly will neglect his duty. While the State has made adequate provision for the deaf, dumb, and blind, I the State, it is thought by many that provision should also be made for an equally unfortunate and equally meritorious class of our citizens – the imbecile  or  weak-minded  children  or  youth  of  poor  parents.    If  anything  can  be  done,  in  any  degree,  to ameliorate the condition of that unfortunate class, within the authority of the General Assembly, I have no doubt that authority will be exerted in their behalf. For the purpose of aiding the cause of temperance among the people, laws have been enacted and are now in full  force,  prohibiting  the  traffic  in  alcoholic  or  intoxicating  drinks.    It  is  to  be  feared  that  in  some  parts  of  the State  at  least,  these  laws  are  lamentably  neglected,  if  not  wholly  disregarded.    I  respectfully  submit  whether some plan may not and ought not to be devised which shall secure the more faithful execution and enforcement of the laws. From a source entitled to high consideration, I have been requested to recommend that provision be made by law  for  the  establishing  in  every  town  in  the  State  a  public  library  of  suitable  and well  selected  books,  for  the use of the inhabitants of the town, under proper regulations.  I would recommend the subject to your candid and thorough examination. FOREIGN INSURANCE COMPANIES. The people of this State are very deeply interested in the matter of insurance.  A great amount of property is insured  in,  and  large  sums  of money  are  paid  to,  foreign  corporations.   Many of  such  corporations have  failed; some  have  proved  worthless.    Our  citizens  have  been  and  are  still  liable  to  be  defrauded  and  injured.    The Commissioners, who  have  in  a  limited  sense  this matter  in  charge,  receive  no  compensation  for  their  services.  Is not the subject worthy your careful consideration? Before closing this communication, I desire to say, that with profound gratitude to my fellow citizens for the exalted position to which their kindness has raised me, it gives me great pleasure and awakens a just pride – as I know  it  does  in  the  bosom  of  every  Vermonter  –  to  cast  a  retrospective  glance  over  the  entire  history  of  our commonwealth, and find  that, with so few exceptions,  the complicated machinery of our system of government has  operated  so  harmoniously,  each  department  being  assigned  to  able,  devoted,  and  faithful  servants.    Those entrusted  with  the  financial  affairs  of  our  State  have  usually  been  honest,  vigilant  and  trustworthy.    The judiciary,  always  the  safeguard  of  the  people’s  rights,  and  the  conservator  of  the  peace  and  good  order  of  any community,  have  invariably  been  impartial,  independent  and  upright  –  administering  the  laws  with  an unflinching  fidelity,  and  dispensing  justice  with  an  even  balance.    That  judiciary,  for  ability  and  learning,  and other  eminent  qualifications,  has  ever  commanded  the  high  respect  and  consideration  of  the  men  of  most eminent juridicial ability in this State and the other States in the Union. Our  soldiery,  peaceable,  industrious,  intelligent  and  patriotic  as  citizens,  ever  ready  to  shoulder  the musket and  buckle  on  the  armor  at  their  country’s  call,  from  the  days  of  Ethan  Allen  and  Seth Warner  to  the  present moment,  have  shown  themselves  as  daring  and  invincible  on  the  battle  field,  as  they  are  peaceful,  industrious and patriotic in private life.  They have deserved and received the nation’s praise, admiration and gratitude. Education, ever  the handmaid of morality and religion, has always been fostered and nurtured with parental care  and  a mother’s  affection.   The  log  cabin,  the  school-house  and  the  church  have  reared  up  a  class  of  noble men  and  women,  who  have  adorned  every  art,  trade,  calling  and  profession  throughout  the  land,  from  the honored  tiller  of  the  soil  to  the  dignified  and  learned  physician,  lawyer,  judge,  statesman,  theologian  –  thereby reflecting  high  honor  on  the  State  and  nation,  till  the  name  Vermonter  has  become,  as  it  were,  a  synonym  for worth  and  merit,  and  a  passport  to  confidence  and  respect.    May  this  ever  be  her  history,  and  this  people continue that “happy people whose God is the Lord.” I  need  not  say  that  economy,  both  of  time  and money, will  be  consulted  by making  as  brief  a  session  as  is consistent with the due consideration of the several matters that come before you. I am not aware of any necessity for important changes in our statutes.  Allow me to ask whether there is not greater  danger  of  too  much  rather  than  too  little  legislation?    Upon  this  question  I  would  appeal  to  the experience of  those upon whom  is devolved  the duty of administering  the  laws.   I shall be pardoned, I  trust, for suggesting  that  under  our  present  constitution,  requiring  only  biennial  sessions,  increased  vigilance  should  be exercised to guard against hasty and inconsiderate legislation. I pledge my hearty co-operation  in expediting  the proper business of  the session.   I respectfully refer you to the  reports of  the various departments and  to  the suggestions  therein, several of which without  fault on  the part   of anyone, I have been unable to see.       JULIUS CONVERSE. }  EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,      Montpelier, October 3, 1872
