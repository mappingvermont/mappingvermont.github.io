Inaugural address of  Deane C. Davis  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1971           Thursday, January 7, 1971 Inaugural Address  Lt.  Governor  Burgess,  thank  you  for  what  I  regard  as  one  of  the  most  gracious  introductions  I’ve  ever had bestowed upon me, I  thank you with all my heart, Sir. The other Constitutional Officers, whom we have already greeted, Speaker Kennedy, President  Janeway, Bishop  Joyce, Rabbi Wall, my own Pastor, Rev. Mr. Brockway, who has tried from time to time to keep me on the straight path, sometimes successful, Mr. Chief Justice, Holden,  the  other  Justices  of  our  Supreme Court,  for which  it’s  been my  privilege  to  practice  some years  ago,  Senator  Aiken,  and  the  other  Distinguished  former  Governors  or  I  think  I  should  say  the  other former Distinguished Governors, Members of this Joint Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen. I  feel quite  sure  that you will believe me when  I  say  that  the opportunity  to speak  to you  today  is deeply appreciated  and  in  saying  that  that  it  is  more  than  a  formal  statement.  As  a  matter  of  tradition  on  this  very great  occasion,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  people  of  the  State  of  Vermont  for  giving me this opportunity to serve them once again for two more years. As I look around the House, I can see many who served in the last two sessions of the Vermont Legislature, and I think all in the House served in the last Biennium  with  the  exception  of  51  new  representatives,  and  I  believe  there  are  eight  or  nine  Senators.  In speaking to you this morning, I have sort of a feeling that I should speak to you as a group with whom I have served with for the past two years and in two sessions. I know that some of you thought the two sessions last Biennium  were  a  little  bit  strenuous,  if  it  is  any  comfort  to  you,  I  promise  you  another  one  that  will  be equally strenuous this time. With  your  permission,  I  would  like  to  deliver  three  short  messages;  one  today  in  which  I  will  speak  to you  in  somewhat  general  terms;  one  next  week  in  which  I  will  make  specific  legislative  recommendations; and then the following week the Budget message. So today, I would like to offer a quick overview of what has been happening in Vermont as I see it, in the hope  that  it  will  help  bring  into  focus  our  circumstances,  our  needs  and  to  some  extent,  our  resources.  I’m sure  that  some  of  you  people  have  read  frequently  Kenneth  Crawford,  whom  I  regard  as  a  very  perceptive observer of the American scene. As you know, he just retired and he wrote his Swan Song in Newsweek just two or  three weeks ago, and  I  think he made  some pertinent observations  that might be  considered pertinent here today. He said, “Anyone who has lived as an adult through the last half century has seen more history in the  making  than  anyone  who  ever  lived  before  him.  There  has  been  more  change,  more  cataclysm,  more invention, more progress and more deterioration than ever happened in any previous fifty years.” And  I  think  he  might  have  added:  more  controversy  and  disagreement  concerning  fundamental  issues affecting  the State  and  the Nation. Some of  those  fundamental  issues  are  coming before you  this  session  for resolution. These  issues  are  coming  to  a  head  because  social  and  technological  changes  are  occurring  at  an unprecedented  rate.  But  the  capacity  of  Government  to  respond  to  change  we  find  is  being  eroded  by inflation,  rising unemployment… exhaustion of  revenue sources.  .  . and  to a great extent by changing public attitudes. The  outlook  in  many  of  our  sister  states  is  grim  indeed  .  .  .  so  grim  that  some  Governors  at  the  last meeting  of  Governors  at  Sun  Valley  expressed  deep  and  sincere  fears  of  an  imminent  breakdown  of Governmental  services  and  structures.  Although  Vermont  has  some  difficult  decisions  to  make  .  .  .  our prospects,  at  least  by  comparison,  are  generally  good.  That  is  so  because  you  grasped  the  nettle  and  passed the sales tax and you, by that act, put Vermont in a position almost unique among the fifty States. All around us, States  are  staggering  under  virtually  unmanageable  deficits. Other Governors  are  calling  for massive  tax increases  in  their  Legislative  messages.  I  shall  not  do  so  because  you,  recognized  the  problem,  passed  the sales tax, and put the State of Vermont in a position of fiscal soundness. However,  fundamental  issues  do  remain,  and  you  must  deal  with  them.  The  details  will  become  more clear  as  this  session moves on. Today,  I  should  like  to give you  the broad outlines of  the decisions  I believe you must make. But  first  …  let  us  look  at  our  Vermont  situation  as  we  move  on  into  the  1970’s.    Let’s  count  our blessings. We have an excellent system of elementary, secondary, and higher education. We have a highway system which ranks among the best of all the fifty States. We  have  one  of  the  most  generous  welfare  systems—one  which  is  designed  to  permit  truly  deserving people to receive assistance without loss of dignity or self respect. We  have  a  penal  and  corrections  system  which  many  authorities  outside  the  State  of  Vermont,  say  is  a model that other States ought to adopt. We  have  a  modern,  highly  sophisticated  system  for  treatment  of  mental  illness  in  its  many  and  diverse forms. It is manifestly more humane than the custodial system we had only a few years ago. It is much more effective  in  restoring  increasing  numbers  to  productive  employment  or  if  not  that  at  least  the  capability  to live in their own homes and in their own communities in comfort and safety. We  are  paying  an  impressive  price  for  all  of  this,  and  some  of  the  bills  are  only  now  coming  due.  To finance this high standard of service, Vermont has undertaken the second highest tax load of any State in the Nation on an average income basis. Our tax effort needs no apology from anyone, to anyone. During  the  last  two years, we have  improved  the  level of  services  in many of  these  areas mentioned  and we have added new directions and new emphases. For example: Last  year,  you  provided  bold  new  standards  for  the  protection  of  our  land,  water,  and  air,  the  natural resources upon which life itself depends—The Clean Waters Act, the Development Regulations Act, and the Land  Use  Plan.  All  of  these  together  with  legislation  setting  up  air  standards  are  the  solid  foundation  upon which  aroused  and  determined  citizens  will  move  forward  toward  preserving  and  improving  the  quality  of life in our State. You  have  moved  emphatically  toward  improvements  of  our  outdated  and  fragmented  administrative branch.  One  of  the  eight  proposed  cabinet  groupings,  the  Environmental  Conservation  Agency,  came  into being, by your mandate, June 1, 1970. It has already shown its capacity for rapid and effective action. Within forty-eight  hours  after  our  mercury  problem  became  known,  this  Agency  had  put  together  an  able  team  of technicians  and  in  collaboration  with  outside  experts,  embarked  earlier  than  any  other  state  upon  a  most searching examination of the problem. The same Agency took over the handling of applications for permits under Development Regulations. By mere  fact  of  being  an  Agency  with  its  component  elements  has  reduced  the  time  frame  for  handling  these applications  from  an  average  of  four  months  to  approximately  thirty  days.  Opportunities  abound  for  other demonstrations of flexibility and effectiveness. The two other cabinet groupings which you authorized, the Agency of Human Resources and the Agency of Development and Community Affairs, become effective, by your mandate, in just three days. Planning for the Development  and Community Affairs Agency  is well  along. Present  indications  are  that we will be  able to reduce the present number of staff positions, in this grouping, from 95 to 75 and still properly discharge all of the functions hitherto performed by the separate divisions of the Agency. It  is  my  hope  that  you  will  move  forward  during  this  session  with  the  implementation  of  the  other  five cabinet systems where even greater opportunities exist. You provided a new formula for distribution of State aid to Education and you increased the level of such aid from $18.8 to $27.2 millions of dollars per year, an increase of about 50%. You provided long overdue real estate and rent relief for the elderly. You  improved  hospitalization  and  insurance  programs  for  State  employees  and  substantially  raised  their wages. You made improvements in the Student Assistance program and increased its funding. You  established  the  Municipal  Bond  Bank  which  has  already  enabled  48  communities  to  sell  $41.2 million dollars of bonds at a more favorable rate. This is the first bank of its kind in the nation. These are just a few of the highlights of the many bills you enacted into law during the last two years. Now let us turn to those areas of fundamental decisions I mentioned earlier. The  two  largest  demands  upon  the  State’s  revenues  are  public  education  and  Social  Welfare.  Public education  costs grow  at  an  annual  rate of between 16%  and  18%. At  the  same  time,  the  annual  rate  of  pupil increase is less than 4%. Since 1967 welfare costs in State funds alone have grown by 400%, or at an average annual rate of 80%. The trend is still moving dangerously upward. The State’s revenues are growing at only 7%. We cannot fund both welfare and education at the level we would like … and certainly not at the level some are convinced we should. I am sure you share with me the belief that if we are to break the cycle of poverty and its resulting human and  social  costs  …  we  must  address  ourselves  to  the  treatment  of  causes  rather  than  symptoms.  A  high quality  education  for  every Vermont  child  is  part  of  the  long-range  solution.  But  the  tragedy  is  that  a  long-term solution is of little help to a child who is hungry, sick, or cold this winter. He must have … and we must give him … short-term help. So you must make  the decision  to balance  the need for State assistance to the schools which educate 106 thousand Vermont children and  the obligation of  the State  to  feed, clothe, and house nearly 14,000 Vermont children for whom Social Welfare is the only source of support. One  of  the  most  encouraging  developments  in  our  attempts  to  break  the  poverty  cycle,  has  been  the spectacular success of  the child care center program you established, with an appropriation,  last year of only $125,000.  That  money  has  grown  ten  fold,  to  over  one  million  dollars  with  the  local  and  Federal contributions, which your appropriations generated. With  that,  we  have  tripled  the  number  of  licensed  child  care  centers  to  91  since  the  last  session adjourned.  Those  centers  care  for  over  sixteen  hundred  Vermont  children  …  seven  hundred  of  whom  are from  families  either  on  welfare  or  struggling  to  stay  off  the  welfare  rolls.    Several  hundred  mothers  have been  freed  to contribute  to  their  family’s  support … and  the children  themselves will benefit  from  increased emotional …  social …  and  intellectual  stimulation.  It  is my  firm  belief  that  these  centers  will  lessen  future welfare expenditures … lower crime and delinquency rates … and reduce the future population of the State’s mental and correctional facilities. In addition to day care, the work incentive program offers great hope for rehabilitation of welfare clients. Here  in  Vermont  the  work  incentive  program  has  proved  to  be  a  successful  forerunner  to  the  Family Assistance  plan.  It  has  proved  that  a  substantial  number  of  welfare  recipients  can  be  encouraged  ...  with economic  incentives  and  necessary  supportive  services …  to  take  training  and  accept  jobs.  And  these  jobs can be good jobs.  In two years, 838 welfare clients have been enrolled: of these 190 hold jobs at the present time. And there are 139 presently engaged in training. I am convinced  that  the real solution  to Welfare will come only with basic Welfare reform at  the Federal level,  I’d  like  to  say  that  again,  because  this  is  something  that  we  should  all  be  aware  of,  that  real Welfare reform  can  only  come when  there  is  a  basic Welfare  reform  program  in  action  at  the  Federal  level,  plus  the institution  of  high  level  of  revenue  slashing.  And  thank  heaven,  both  of  these  at  the  moment  seem  more imminent. But  however  encouraging  day  care  centers  ...  the  family  assistance  program  .  .  .  or  revenue  sharing may seem  as  long-term  solutions  to  the  welfare  program  ...  we  must  keep  in  mind  that  the  sick,  the  aged,  the disabled and the poor and their children must be helped now. Part  and  parcel  of  the  funding  crisis  is  the  necessity  to  establish  a  goal  for  the  economic  growth  of Vermont. One  of  the  questions  we  need  to  face  is  the  extent  to  which  we  want  to  see  Vermont  developed. Many love Vermont the way it is. It is a haven of peace and quiet and represents the good life for many. They dread to  see  its  essential  character  changed, yet  these  same people  and many others  are pressing  for good  schools, good roads, good police protection and a modern and up-to-date approach to our problems of ecology, health, mental health and all the other basic services to our people. It  is  just  so  fundamentally  simple  and  elementary  simple  that we  cannot  have  an  increasingly  high  level of  public  services  without  an  expanding  economy  and  an  expanding  tax  base.  Growth  means  more industry—more  industry  means  more  jobs,  more  jobs  mean  more  people  earning  money.  The  last  thing  we want is explosive development. It would certainly create more problems than it would solve and greatly alter the  substance of  life  in our State. On  the other hand,  I do believe  that Vermonters are entitled  to a  fair  share of the economic benefits of a modern society. There  is  a middle ground.  It  is  a posture of balance.  It  is  a program of  gradualness. A  program  in which we fiercely seek  the protection of our environment yet seek  the goal of gradual, sound growth as essential  to our  needs  a  growth which  does  not  damage  our  countryside  but  does  increase  our  average  income  and  does provide  an  increasing  number  of  job  opportunities  for  our  people;  a  goal which would maintain  the  balance needed  to  preserve  a  healthy  agriculture,  a  healthy  recreation  and  a healthy  industry.  I do not  think we need to  develop  ourselves  out  of  living  space,  nor  stand  idly  by  and  see  the  same  result  accomplished  by  frantic immigration. But,  I  think  reasonable growth  is essential  to  the kind of  life  that Vermonters desire, and ought to have. The  answer  is  in  regulation …  regulation  built  upon  choice …  regulation  designed  to  use  our  land  and water  and  air—wisely—reasonably—and  fairly  and  consistent  with  the  long  term  interests  of  all.  Such regulation  in  and  of  itself  will  have  some  restraining  effect  upon  growth.  We  must  accept  this.  Indeed  we must seek it. But in the long run it will build a sounder, stronger, and more enjoyable community. This  program means we must  submit  to more  governmental  direction  and  control  than we will  like. We have not yet begun  to see or  feel  the conflicts  that will arise as enforcement of our environmental  legislation moves ahead. This regulation encroaches upon many areas hitherto considered safely and eternally within the sanctity  of  individual  rights.  This  conflict  will  express  itself  in  litigation  and  perhaps  even  in  organized attempts to undo much of what you did in the last session. I  firmly  believe  the  greatest  contribution  you  can make  to  your  State  is  to  stand  firm  when  this  conflict arises. If correction  is needed  in minor respects, as  it will be, make  it. But our goal  is far  too  important  to be lost in the backlash of annoyance that will inevitably result. What I am saying is that we must strive for balance in all things. I have outlined to you the balance I feel we must  achieve  in  a  number  of  critically  important  areas  of  the  State’s Government.  So,  there  remains  the structure upon which that Government rests . . . The State’s Economy. The economy is formed by a tripod of agriculture, recreation and industry. This is a simple fact that must be  in  the  forefront  of  our  thinking.  It  is  the  mix  which  these  three  occupations  produce  that  determines  the essential  character  of  Vermont.  The  rural  scene  so  characteristic  of  Vermont  is  diminishing.  Farmers  are fighting  a  difficult  and  often  losing  battle  with  high  farm  wages,  high  costs  of  machinery,  equipment  and supplies.  The  fact  that  farmers  buy  at  retail  and  sell  at  wholesale  compounds  the  problem.  This  erosion  is principally in the area of the small farm which does not lend itself so readily to an economic operation in this age of technology. The number of dairy farms with 50 or 60 cows has remained stable for the last seven years, in spite of our total  loss,  and  farms  with  60  or  more  cows  have  gradually  increased  during  this  same  period.  Total  dairy farm  income  has  substantially  increased  and  is  increasing  still.  I  am  convinced  that  dairy  farming  will  be around in Vermont for quite a while, and it is in our selfish interest to make sure that it is. But  for  many  farmers,  the  straw  that  often  breaks  the  camel’s  back  is  the  spectacular  upward  push  of open  land values, based upon  competition  and  speculation, which  soon  reflects  itself  in a  level of  real estate taxation which  cannot  be  supported  either  by  dairy  farming  or  any  other  forms  of  agriculture  indigenous  to Vermont. In  many  towns  a  much  higher  proportionate  share  of  the  costs  of  local  government  is  being  transferred from  the  built-up  sections  of  the  towns  and  villages  to  the  farms,  forests  and  open  lands.  This  is  being accomplished  by  the  application  of  the market  value  concept  of  real  estate  appraisal which  is  the  key  factor in the distribution of the local tax burden. This  is  a  disturbing  phenomenon.  It  presents  the  danger  of  dramatically  changing  the  quality  of  life  in Vermont.  The  social  values  inherent  in  farm  life,  particularly  in  dairy  farming,  have,  for  a  long  time  in  the past,  made  a  substantial  and  wholesome  contribution  to  the  moral  values,  the  political  philosophy,  and  the mores of our distinctive Vermont community. Moreover, to the extent that we are concerned with development of our State, the open spaces devoted to active  farming  are  a  real  asset.  The  pastoral  scene  has  tremendous  drawing  power  for  vacationers, recreationists  and  people who  come  here  to  live  in  increasingly  larger  numbers  are  seeking  escape  from  the physical and psychological disadvantages of big city living. There  is strength  in  the diversity of our economy. The  long-term future of dairy farming  in Vermont will be  decided  by  economic  forces  beyond  our  control. But  the  sudden  and  violent  upswing  of  real  estate  taxes caused by  the  sudden, violent and disproportionate  rise of  real estate values has had a devastating effect and impact on  the  small  farmer. Only  retired  senior citizens have experienced anything quite  like  it.  Insofar as  it lies  in our power …  I believe we must  ensure  that  this  temporary phenomenon does not permanently distort the  patterns  of  land  use …  the  makeup  of  the  state’s  economy  ...  or  indeed  the  very  character  of  Vermont. Only a land use tax can forestall that distortion. In  conclusion,  I  have  tried  in  these  few  minutes  this  morning  to  summarize  some  of  the  more  pressing problems facing us as we launch this new biennium. I will have more specific recommendations on these and other matters in my next message to you.  The governmental process is a remarkable experience. Last Spring you left Montpelier after completing one of the most productive legislative sessions in Vermont history and I am sure many of you felt that most of the tough decisions had been made and the next session would have to be easier. But,  today, we meet  again  and  the  agenda  facing  you  is  equally  as  challenging  and  equally  as  important to  our  people  and  their  future. While  it  is  tempting  to  take  some  comfort  from  the  fact  that  our  lot  here  in Vermont  may  be  easier  than  some  of  our  neighboring  states,  we  must  also  realize  this  has  come  about because Vermonters have  tried  to keep a step ahead of  the problems and have acted before  the crisis became acute. It is our duty to maintain that tradition again this year and face up to our responsibilities. There are still so many unmet needs  in Vermont. We must conserve our  strength and use  it wisely  to be able  to meet  those needs. All  of  us  here  asked  the  voters  last  year  for  the  privilege  and  the  opportunity  to  serve. As we meet  here this morning in this historic hall that has been so beautifully redecorated, the time has come for us to deliver. The eyes of the State are upon us. I am confident we can meet the challenge. And  I want  to  do my  level  best  during  this  session  and  including  session  next  year,  to  be  as  helpful  as  I can  towards  the  legislative  process,  which  is  your  major  responsibility.  My  responsibility,  under  the Constitution and  the  statute,  is  to make  recommendations, which  I  shall do according  to my own belief. The Governor  proposes,  and  the  legislature  disposes,  and  I  ask  that  you  keep  that  difference  clearly  in  mind during your sessions, but I also ask for you to consider whether this is not a time in our History when perhaps we  could  do  just  a  little  better  job  in  creating  a  two  way  communication,  I’ve  learned  a  little  something  in two years about communicating with legislature. I’ve great respect for our Vermont legislature. In Vermont it is  one  of  our  great  strengths  by  which  we  do  nothing  to  imperil  it  or  permit  it  to  deteriorate.  There  is  a difference between using  the  two party system  for  the purpose of advancement because of  the  interest of  the whole people of the State and using it solely for our own interest and the support of our own parties. The job of finding where this line is, it isn’t the easiest thing in the world, nevertheless, the principle, I think is sound. As  far as  I’m concerned,  I would  like  to help create  indication. We will have an exercise  in unity as good as ever has existed in the history of the state. REMARKS FROM THE CHAIR Thank you governor,  for giving us  that calm and  thoughtful appraisal of our position  in  the beginning of the eighth decade of this Century. I think you have helped us all a lot. We  are  gathered  here  today  Governor  Davis,  to  do  honor  to  you  at  your  Inaugural,  as  others  in  this building and this State are doing and you might be surprised to know by some without the State. I would like to read to this Joint Assembly at this time a telegram which was addressed to you Governor Davis, here at the State  House.  “Inauguration  Day  is  a  time  of  beginning  and  hope.  Your  past  efforts  have  truly  earned  the support, the confidence and good will of the people of Vermont, as you begin this new term as Governor, Pat and  I  join  in  sending  you  hearty  congratulations  and  warm  wishes  that  the  future  will  bring  you  continued success. With best personal regards, Richard Nixon.”
