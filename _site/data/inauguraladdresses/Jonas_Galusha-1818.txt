Executive  Speech of  Jonas Galusha  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume VI.  1818      October, 9, 1818. SPEECH OF GOV. GALUSHA– 18181.  Gentlemen  of  the Council,  and Gentlemen  of  the General  Assembly,  – Having  been  called  by  the  suffrages of a free people, and permitted  by divine providence to assemble agreeable to the provisions of the constitution, to attend to the civil concerns of the state, it behooves us at all  times, but more especially when acting under so important a trust, to look  up to Him who has the hearts of all men in his hand, and is the disposer of events, for direction and support in attending to all the duties that devolve on us as guardians of the rights and privileges of the people. It  is  with  peculiar  pleasure  I  congratulate  you  on  the  present  prosperity  of  the  State  and  nation.    Peace, health,  and  plenty  are  among  the  peculiar  blessings  with  which  we  are  favored;  while  an  apparent  increase  of morality, benevolence and piety, presage still happier times. The  recent  dangers  we  have  passed  will  be  a  sufficient monitor  to  keep  alive  in  your  hearts  a  sense  of  the necessity  of  union,  and  that watchful  care  and  perseverance which  are  indispensable  to  the  preservation  of  the rights  and privileges of  a  free people.    It would be  folly  in us  to  imagine  that  the only dangers,  to which  a  free people  are  exposed,  exist  in  times  of  the most  ardent  struggles,  when  assailed  by  powerful  foreign  foes.    This we have  experienced  and  surmounted; but political experience demonstrates  that  the more  fatal  foe  lurks  in  the heart  of man;  that  secret  ambition  to  aggrandize  himself  and  promote  his  own  private  ends,  chills  his  generous ardour  for  the  concerns  of  his  country;  and  his  desire  for  the  prosperity  of  his  fellow  citizens  is  too  apt  to  lie dormant  or  smothered  in  his  bosom;  but  I  am  unwilling  to  believe  that  the  vital  spark  of  patriotism  and republican  virtue  is  extinguished  in  the  hearts  of Americans.    I  appeal  to  you, Gentlemen, who  are well  versed in ancient and modern history, whether the fall of republics have not oftener happened in consequence of a slow decline  of  republican  virtues  and  simplicity,  and  from  internal  divisions,  than  from  any  combination  of  kings and monarchs  to  overthrow  them.    In  times  of  the  greatest  apparent  security,  the  seeds  of  dissolution  are  often sown, and imperceptibly grow, until the roots become too strong to be eradicated. The  remarks,  Gentlemen  are  not  made  with  a  view  to  any  political  party,  or  particular  individuals,  or  to discourage  any  laudable  enterprise,  but  to  check  that  aspiring  ambition  to  which  the  human  heart  is  exposed, and  to  prevent,  in  times  of  apparent  safety,  our  lapsing  into  a  state  of  inattention  to  our  political  concerns, through a natural propensity to ease, which sometimes proves dangerous.  A people negligent of their rights will not long retain their liberties. It behooves you, Gentlemen, not only to watch over the exigencies arising within this State, but carefully to guard  against  any  encroachments  on  the  sovereignties  of  the  individual  States,  or  infringements  on  the privileges reserved to them, or to the people. A  prudent  legislature  will  critically  examine  every  new  subject  that  may  be  presented  for  their consideration,  compare  it with  the  first  principles of our government,  and  trace  it  to  its most probably  effect  in its fullest operation, in order to decide on its merits. In  acting  on  all  private  bills  and  petitions,  a  due  regard  to  justice  ought  never  to  be  dispensed  with;  and favors  ought  only  to  be  granted when  they  do  not  interfere with  the  public  good,  or  that  interest  and  happiness of  other  individuals.    In  passing  laws which  are  to  have  a  partial  operation,  it will  be well  to  keep  in  view  that excellent  maxim  contained  in  our  bill  of  rights,  that  “government  is  or  ought  to  be  instated  for  the  common benefit,  protection  and  security  of  the  people,  nation,  or  community,  and  not  for  the  particular  emolument  or advantage of any single man, family, or set of men, who are a part only of that community.” It would be  trespassing on your  time,  if not on your patience,  to attempt  to call your attention  to  the several matters  that  will  naturally  fall  under  your  consideration.    The  attention  of  former  legislatures  has  been frequently  occupied  on  the  subject  of  education.    A  subject  so  interesting  to  the  rising  generation,  and  so necessary  to  the  happiness,  safety,  and  honor  of  the  State,  cannot  easily  escape  the  notice  of  this  or  any  future                                                  1 Printed Assembly Journal of 1818, corrected.  Legislature.    The  subject  of  manufacturing,  and  the  regulation  of  the  militia,  are  matters  usually  submitted  to standing committees, therefore particular remarks on those subjects will be unnecessary. Many useful improvements have been made in the State, while no considerable attempts have been made to improve  our  state  of  agriculture.   Although  we  ought  to  rely  as much  as  possible  on  home manufactures  for  a supply of manufactured articles, yet it must be acknowledged that the main source of our wealth and subsistence of every class of citizens, must depend on the cultivating of the soil.  When our farms were new and unimpaired by  tillage,  it was  profitable  to  extend  our  labours  and  cast  our  seed  over  a  large  portion  of  our  soil,  but  as  our lands become  less productive by  the frequency of crops,  it  is necessary  that new modes of husbandry should be resorted  to,  in order  to keep  them  in a fertile state, and  that  the different qualities of  the soil be  improved  to  the best advantage for tillage or grazing – which in all probability will require more labor and expense in cultivating an equal quantity of land, and of course prevent the too frequent emigration of the laboring class of our citizens.  I do not  expect  that  the  state of or  finances  is  such  as  to  admit  of  expenditures  on  the  subject; yet  it  is possible that  something  may  be  done  that  would  prove  useful,  by  authorizing  patriotic  and  enterprising  individuals  to form  into  societies,  with  corporate  privileges,  for  the  beneficial  purposes  of  advancing  agricultural  interests, encouraging manufactures, and improving our breed of domestic animals, within the several counties where it is deemed necessary.  I am apprised that an agricultural society was incorporated in the year 1806, but this society being  extended  over  the  whole  State,  the  members  being  so  remote  from  each  other,  and  the  field  for examinations  so  extensive  that  it  proved  ineffectual,  and  now  exists  only  in  name.    I  am,  however,  of  opinion, that  societies  formed  within  proper  limits  may,  by  experiments,  proper  researches,  and  correspondence  with each  other,  prove  highly  beneficial;  for,  notwithstanding  the  spirit  of  industry  and  laudable  enterprise  that appears among our citizens, yet much remains to be done for the benefit of individuals, and the State, by a wise direction of  their  labors and expenditures, to the most profitable objects, and  in  the most useful and economical manner; but a treatise on the subject would, on the present occasion, be improper; a hint only is my design. In selecting  the officers  to be appointed by  the General Assembly, your own prudence will  lead you  to seek for  men  of  integrity,  and  uprightness  of  conduct,  as  well  as  of  competent  capacity,  to  discharge  the  various duties attached to the several offices for which they are to be elected.  It will be necessary at this session to elect a Senator from this State to the Senate of the United States, to serve for the term of six years from and after the third  day  of  March  next;  and  also  to  fill  the  vacancy  in  that  body  occasioned  by  the  resignation  of  the  Hon. James Fisk. Sundry  communications  have  been  made  to  me  since  the  last  session  of  the  General  Assembly,  for  your consideration; all which shall be seasonably submitted. Your  own  interest,  and  that  of  your  constituents,  will  engage  your  speedy  and  faithful  attention  to  the business  of  the  session,  and  bring  the  same  to  a  close  as  early  as  the  nature  and  extent  of  the matters  you may have  under  your  consideration  will  admit.    My  best  endeavors  to  second  every  measure  you  may  adopte,  to promote  the  public weal, will  not  be wanting;  and  it  is my  anxious  desire,  that  a  spirit  of  harmony  and  candor may  prevail with  us,  and  that  the  result  of  our  doings may  terminate  in  the  best  interests  of  the  state,  and meet the approbation of our constituents.
