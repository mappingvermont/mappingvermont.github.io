Inaugural address of  Carroll S. Page  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1890   Thursday, October 2, 1890 Inaugural Address  GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  The constitution of our State requires the governor to prepare such business as may appear to him necessary to lay before the general assembly. An  examination  of  the  several  interests  of  the  State,  made  with  as  much  care  as  the  limited  time  at  my command  would  permit,  has  profoundly  impressed  me  with  the  magnitude  and  the  importance  of  the  work before you. Inasmuch  as  the  whole  system  of  State  taxation  must  be  readjusted  to  conform  to  recent  decisions  of  our supreme  court,  grave  constitutional  questions  will  present  themselves  for  your  consideration.    The  increasing scale  of  State  expenditures,  at  a  time when  the  leading  industry  of  our  State  is  abnormally  depressed, makes  it especially incumbent on you to approach the question of taxation with more than usual determination to lighten the  burdens  of  the  people.  The  unsatisfactory  workings  of  our  present  school  law  and  the  largely  increased responsibility  resting  upon  you,  because  of  recent  liberal  grants  by  the  national  congress,  in  aid  of  the agricultural department of our State University, are both subjects of the highest importance. Invoking  the  guidance  of  Him  without  whose  aid  and  direction  all  our  labors  are  vain,  let  us  approach  the work  of  the  session  with  a  firm  resolve  to  discharge  the  great  responsibilities  resting  upon  us  as  the representatives of the people, fearlessly, impartially and faithfully. STATE FINANCES. By  reference  to  the  report  of  the  State  treasurer,  it  appears  that  the  receipts  and  disbursements  for  the  23 months ending June 30, 1890, have been as follows: RECEIPTS.

One  of  the  most  important  subjects  demanding  your  consideration  is  the  largely  increased  cost  of conducting our State affairs. With the single exception of our Legislative Assemblies, every department shows a growing expense to the State, and yet the growth has been so gradual that it is only by a comparison of biennial periods that the unpleasant fact is brought home to us with proper force. A  comparison  of  the  biennial  period  ending  August  1,  1882,  with  that  ending  August  1,  1890,  shows  that whereas  $568,000  paid  the  running  expenses  of  our  State  for  the  first  biennial  period  of  the  decade,  it  took $951,000  for  the  last  biennial  period;  and  this  too,  notwithstanding  the  fact,  that  in  nearly  every  department  of business, the legitimate returns of labor and capital have been upon a constantly descending scale.  346,525 00 I ask your careful attention  to  the  following  table which has been prepared with considerable care, and  is,  I believe,  substantially  correct;  it  shows  the  expenditure  in  each  department  in  each  of  the  biennial  periods  as reported by the State auditor comprises only 23 months, I have added one-twenty-third in some cases in order to arrive at correct conclusions: TABLE.

SPECIAL APPROPRIATIONS. The  tendency  of  each  succeeding Legislature  for  the  past  ten years has been  to guard  the  treasury with  less and less care against the demands made upon it in the interests of special objects. The  entire  sum  paid  out  on  acts  of  special  appropriation  for  the  two  years  ending  July  31,  1882,  was  only $25,895.77,  while  the  special  appropriations  made  by  the  Legislature  of  1888,  or  paid  during  the  last  biennial term under former acts, make the unprecedented aggregate of $192,330.25, as appears by the following detailed statement: Middlebury College .................................................................................................................$  4,800 00 Gettysburg Monument ...............................................................................................................  15,880 00 University of Vermont and Experiment Station ........................................................................  17,250 00 Grand Isle Bridge .......................................................................................................................  20,000 00 Soldiers’ Home ..........................................................................................................................  26,544 35 New Insane Asylum ...................................................................................................................  100,000 00 Miscellaneous ............................................................................................................................ 7,855 90    −−−−−−−−−−    $192,330 25 In  the  general  statement  of  total  expenditures,  the  item  of  special  appropriations  for  the  last  biennial  period includes $100,000  for new  insane asylum, which, although exhausted by contracts already  let, has been only  in part paid over to the contractors. The time will never come when a multitude of patriotic and charitable objects may not properly appeal to us for assistance, and I should regret to see any evidence of a disposition to withhold needed support.   The present tendency  is,  however,  toward  prodigality,  and  I  urge  that  you  scan  carefully  every  bill,  asking  for  an appropriation for special and extraordinary purposes, giving your approval to such only, as clearly appear to you to be demanded by the honor and welfare of the State. TAX ON CORPORATIONS. The  supreme  court  of  Vermont  has  decided  that  our  statute,  taxing  earnings  of  transportation  companies, received  from  interstate  traffic,  is  in  violation  of  the  constitution  of  the United  States.    It will  therefore  be  you duty  to  enact  a  law  by  which  these  corporations  may  be  legally  called  upon  to  bear  their  share  of  the  public burdens.    The  satisfactory  solution  of  this  problem  will  demand  the  exercise  of  the  greatest  care,  in  order  that the courts may not again decide unconstitutional such a law as may be enacted. To  no  other  subject  considered  in  this  message,  have  I  devoted  so  much  thought,  but  inasmuch  as  the honorable commissioner of State  taxes has given  the subject an exhaustive  investigation,  I conclude  to offer no definite  suggestions  at  this  time.    I  visited  Commissioner  Martin  at  his  home  where  he  was  confined  by sickness,  and  received  from  him  assurance  that  he would,  early  in  the  session,  submit  for  your  consideration  a bill which he believes will avoid the constitutional objections which render our present law inoperative. Having  settled  the  constitutional  questing,  it  will  be  your  duty  to  consider  whether  the  amount  which corporations  have  been  paying  under  the  existing  law  is  their  equitable  proportion  of  the  public  burden.  Taxation should be just and equal, bearing upon each industry and each class of property alike, considered with reference  to  its  ability  to  pay.    Since  the  passage  of  the  corporation  tax  law  in  1882,  the  amount  to  be  raised annually by taxation for State expenses has been continually increasing, while the ability of the farming lands of Vermont to pay, has been constantly diminishing.  I submit that a re-adjustment is only a matter of justice to the end  that  the  arbitrary  rate,  established  in  1882  under  favorable  conditions,  be  made  to  conform  to  the  present largely  increased  measure  of  expenditure.    Railroad  corporations  now  pay  from  two  to  five  per  cent  of  their gross  earnings;  transportation,  steamboat  and  car  companies  two  per  cent;  express,  telegraph  and  telephone companies three per cent; savings banks and trust companies six-tenths of one per cent on their deposits.  I think these corporations can be asked to contribute one-fifth more than they now pay without doing them an injustice. DOUBLE TAXATION. When the burdens of taxation are not equitably apportioned there is just cause of complaint. The taxation of real  estate  and  at  the  same  time  of  the  mortgage  indebtedness  thereon  imposes  a  double  tax  which  is  clearly unjust.  Equity  demands  that  the  mortgagor  and  the  mortgagee  should  be  taxed  according  to  their  respective interest in the land, I  have  been  unable  to  formulate  to my  own  satisfaction  any  statute  by  which  it  is  practicable  to  effect  the needed change in our present law, but it seems clear to me that, if some method could be devised to remedy the evil, it would lift a burden from the real estate of Vermont which can be removed in no other way. You should consider the question in all its bearings under the light of such full discussion as the importance of the subject will doubtless command. COURT EXPENSES. This  is  a  subject  which  the  State  auditor  has  considered  so  fully  in  his  report,  which  you  will  have  before you,  that  he  has  practically  exhausted  it.  The  unpleasant  deduction  from  the  figures  given  by  him  is  that  this branch  of  State  expense  for  the  past  two  years  has  been  $147,000  as  against  $107,000  for  the  biennial  period ending  July 31, 1888. The average annual expenditure  in  this department  for  the  first  four years of  this decade, 1880 to 1884, was only $46,000. The auditor points out specifically the causes for this increase. You  will  examine  this  matter,  with  that  care  which  its  importance  demands,  and  I  trust  that  with  the  data found  in  the  auditor’s  report,  and  such  personal  information  and  assistance  as  he will  be  able  to  give  you,  you may find some way to cheek this alarming increase in the cost of our courts without impairing their efficiency.  OFFICIAL SALARIES I  recommend  that  you  give  this  branch  of  State  expenditure  a  thorough  investigation,  and  if  you  find  that salaries  have  been  raised  from  term  to  term,  without  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  labor  or  responsibility attached  thereto,  you  should  reduce  them  fearlessly,  and  without  favoritism,  whether  the  incumbent  affected thereby be the governor or the doorkeeper. Service  for  the  State  should  receive  the  same  pay  which  like  service  is  able  to  command  in  other departments of labor where the same degree of ability and responsibility is required, and when the remuneration of  any  official  becomes  so  attractive  that  the  position  is  sought  after  by  many  because  of  the  salary  attaching thereto, the salary should be reduced. STATE’S PRISON AND HOUSE OF CORRECTION. The  discipline  seems  to  be  excellent  at  both  these  institutions.  At  the  State’s  prison,  both  the  total  and  per capita expense has been diminishing since 1880 until the last biennial period, which shows  a  marked  increase  over  the  two  just  preceding.  Since  1884,  the  average  annual  expense  of  maintaining each  inmate at  the State’s prison has been $68.46; at  the house of correction, $27.01. The difference  in favor of the latter is owing to the fact that the fines and costs received at this institution are used to reduce the net cost to the State.  I append the following details of cost of support of the inmates of the State’s prison for the past ten years:          23 MONTHS 1888 to ‘90  $  12,464  32 5,663  79 5,644  23 4,188  68 1,539  45 733  64       3,042  17   $  33,276  28   $  20,056  60 1880 to ‘82   $  13,791  43 8,949  88 4,028  10 6,157  36 1,287  67 18,658  48       4,365  61   $  57,238  53   $  20,110  27 1886 to ‘88 $  12,829  03 5,970  71 6,073  38 4,248  01 1,356  91 1,644  30       3,325  93   $  35,448  27   $  23,675  50  1882 to ‘84 $  12,045  32 6,318  22 5,447  84 5,961  44 1,617  98 1,908  40       4,435  32   $  37,734  52   $  20,272  62                1884 to ‘86 $  12,137  68 5,152  74 5,323  24 4,409  97 1,162  63 824  97       3,250  27   $  32,261  50   $  20,353  00                        STATE’S PRISON.

It does not now occur to me that any legislative action in their behalf is needed. REFORM SCHOOL. It  is  unpleasant  to  communicate  to  you  any  facts  which  seem  to  indicate  an  unwarranted  measure  of expenditure  in  the  management  of  any  institution  drawing  its  support  from  the  State  treasury.  But  in  my opinion,  one  of  the  highest  duties  incumbent  upon  the  executive  is  to  carefully  ascertain  all  important  facts touching  the  management  of  our  State  institutions,  and  communicate  them  unreservedly  to  you,  whether  such facts are pleasant or unpleasant. I  have  made  as  careful  computation  as  the  figures  at  hand  would  permit  and  find  that  the  not  expense, including the expense of trustees, for each scholar cared for at the Reform School has grown from $115 in 1880 to $187 in 1889. The exact figures are as follows: 1880  ......................................................................................................................................   $115 80 119 00 1881  ......................................................................................................................................  207 10 1882  ......................................................................................................................................  1883  ...................................................................................................................................... 208 23 123 51 1884  ......................................................................................................................................  165 36 1885  ...................................................................................................................................... 1886  ...................................................................................................................................... 139 86 137 36 1887  ...................................................................................................................................... 142 13 1888  ...................................................................................................................................... 1889  ...................................................................................................................................... 187 53 The  extraordinary  expenses  incurred  in  1882  and  1883 were  for  permanent  repairs.  I  am  pleased  to  be  able to say  that  the  figures  for  the current year will show a  reduction of something more  than  ten dollars per scholar as compared with 1889. By  reference  to  the  report  of  the  superintendent  it  will  be  seen  that  more  than  58  per  cent  of  the  entire number  of  girls were  of  the  ages of 13  and 14 years  at  the  time of  commitment,  and more  than  one-third  of  all commitments over  eleven years of  age were  for gross  lewdness. Statistics  show  that  in  these  cases  reformation is  effected  in  only  a  small  proportion  of  the  whole  number. With  no  suitable  facilities  for  separating  the  girls according  to  their  offences,  it  seems  evident  that  the  result  of  this  intermingling,  viewed  from  a  moral standpoint,  must  be  harmful.  The  superintendent  informs  me  that  he  does  not  see  how  this  association  can  be avoided  with  the  small  number  to  be  provided  for,  without,  incurring,  unreasonable  expense.  The  highest average number of girls ever  in  the school was 21  in 1889. There were 17  in 1885; 15  in 1887, and 12  in 1889; very  likely one-half of  these girls might have been  cared  for quite  as well  at home, and  the  remainder could be more  satisfactorily  provided  for  at  some  other  institution,  even  if  located  out  of  the  State.  The  superintendent gives it as his opinion that the expense per scholar, in the girls’ department is now nearly or quite double that in the boys’ department, or nearly one dollar per day for each girl cared for. I recommend that a careful in investigation be made into the system upon which this school is conducted, to the end,  that  the expenses  thereof may be  lessened,  if  it can be done without  interfering with  the welfare of  the scholars; and unless a better method can be devised for caring for the girls, I believe you will deem it advisable to abolish this department of the school. SOLDIERS’ HOME. The  directors  of  the  soldiers’  home  will  lay  before  you  a  detailed  statement  of  the  condition  of  this institution.    I  see  no  reason  for  anticipating  an  outlay  on  the  part  of  the State  in  excess  of  $100  per  annum,  for each  inmate of  the home, as  the United States government divides with  the State  the expense of supporting our veterans there until such expense reaches $200 per annum. I  do  not  recall  any  other  institution  in Vermont  receiving  State  aid, whose  directors  do  not  receive  pay  for their services from the State. This institution, however, is managed by a board of Vermont veterans, who appear to  take  sincere  pleasure  in  its  management  for  no  other  reward  than  the  consciousness  of  having  performed  a patriotic  duty;  and  I  am  unable  to  observe  any  evidence  of  less  judicious  management  than  is  bestowed  upon those institutions whose board of direction are paid. I  am  led  to  make  these  suggestions,  not  because  I  would  have  the  State  parsimonious  in  dealing  with  her public  servants,  but  because  it  occurs  to  me  that  we  establish  many  commissions  which  could  be  filled  by  a class  of  our  best  citizens who,  having  their  expenses  paid, would  be  pleased, without  remuneration  and  purely as a matter of patriotism and State pride, to give the State the benefit of their judgment and experience.  I believe no better institution of the kind exists in this country than the Vermont Soldiers’ Home. THE NEW INSANE ASYLUM. The Poland pauper law of 1886, so called, with amendments thereto since made, has operated to change the burden of support of many paupers from  the  town  to  the State. Under  this  law  it  is only necessary for overseers of the poor to prove that their idiotic non-compos, and demented paupers are dangerous, to enable their towns to relieve themselves of the burden of support, by sending them to the State insane asylum. The  State’s  attorney  of  each  county  represents  the  State  in  these  matters,  and,  presumably  investigates carefully all applications for commitment of this class of persons. But as a matter of fact investigations are often practically  exparte  and  the  towns,  with  the  shrewdness  proverbial  in  such  cases,  too  often  find,  little  or  no difficulty in making such a showing as will secure the commitment of its paupers to the asylum. The  supervisors  of  the  insane  are  supposed  to  correct  the  evil  growing  out  of  this  tendency  to  shift  the burden  from  the  town  to  the  State:  and,  to  their  credit  be  it  said,  they  have  been  faithful  defenders  of  the treasury, an a  large number of  the paupers,  improperly committed, have been  returned  to  the  towns  from which they were sent. It is however undoubtedly true that a large number of the inmates of the asylum would be cared for  at  home  were  it  not  for  the  fact  that  by  sending  them  to  the  asylum  the  towns  avoid  the  expense  of  their maintenance. I  am  not  prepared  to  say  that,  from  a  humane  standpoint,  it  is  not  right  that  many  of  these  unfortunate persons be taken care of at the asylum rather than, at home; but unless some additional safeguards are provided, we must squarely meet  the only alternative,  to wit,  the expenditure of a half million dollars within  the next five years  in  the  building  and  equipping  of  an  asylum  capable  of  caring  for  five  or  six  hundred  patients.  This unpleasant  fact was  brought  to  the attention of  the  legislature of 1888,  an  appropriation  of  $100,000 was made for the purpose of building and equipping a new asylum. Under  the  act of 1888,  a  site was  selected  at Waterbury, and  a  contract  let  for  the  erection of  the buildings, the aggregate cost of which, including the site and, architects’ charges, has been in round numbers, $98,000. An additional  appropriation will  be  immediately  required  to  heat,  light  and  furnish  this  new  asylum,  the  estimated expense  thereof being $50,000. When  the $50,000 shall have been expended  the institution will be  in condition to care for from 125 to 150 patients. After  consultation with  the  supervisors  of  the  insane  and  the  trustees  of  the  asylum  at Brattleboro,  it  seems clear  to me  that  no  further  addition  to  the  new  asylum  should  be made  during  the  next  two  years.  They  are  of the opinion  that  the  relief, which  the new  asylum with  its present  capacity will  afford, will  enable  them  to  care for  such  patients  as  shall  be  properly  cared  for  by  the  State  until  the  legislature  of  1892  can  make  further provision  therefor.  I  therefore  recommend  that  a  sum  not  exceeding  $50,000  be  appropriated  to  finish  and furnish  the  new  asylum,  and  if,  at  the  end  of  two  years,  it  is  deemed  expedient  to make  further  appropriations for the purpose of enlarging the institution it can then be done. The  annual  expenditure  on  the  part  of  the  State  for  the  insane  was  in  round  numbers  $20,000  in  1875, $30,000  in 1880, 34,000  in 1885, while  the bill  just paid to  the Brattleboro asylum for  the support of  the  insane the past year is $72,697. STATE BENEFICIARIES IN FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS. During  the  past  two  years  the  State  contributed  to  the  support  of  its  beneficiaries  at  foreign  institutions. $12,829.61, as follows: $5,106 13 American Asylum for deaf and dumb, Hartford, Conn. ................................ 1,040 88 Clark Institution for deaf and dumb mutes, Northampton, Mass .................. 6,147 82 Perkins Institution for blind, Boston, Mass  .................................................. Massachusetts School for feeble minded, Boston, Mass  .............................. 534 78   −−−−−−−−−−    $12,829 61 The  aggregate  of  our  expenditures  for  these  different  classes  of  unfortunates  varies  but  little  from  year  to year, the largest expense during the last fifteen years being $7,193.99, in 1882, the smallest  $4,991.16, in 1876. The average cost per year for fifteen years has been $6,303.02. I  know  of  no  reason  why  the  policy  of  the  State  with  reference  to  the  support  of  these  persons  should  be changed. We cannot afford, to practice economy in this direction, and yet good business, prudence may suggest to  you  the  propriety  of  at  least  a  biennial  inquiry  as  to  the  reasonable  of  the  prices  paid  for  maintenance,  and whether  the,  beneficiaries  are  not  persons  whose  other  means  of  support  are  such  that  the  State  should  be relieved therefrom.  AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE FUND. In 1865 the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College became the recipient of an annual income of  $8,130,  from  what  is  known  as  the  State  Agricultural  College  Fund.  In  1887  the  National  congress  passed what  is  known  as  the  Hatch  bill,  by  virtue  of  which  the  State  agricultural  college  has  since  received  annually, for  the  benefit  of  the  experiment  station,  the  sum  of  $15,000.  In  August  of  the  present  year  another  bill, introduced, by our own  senator, Hon.  J. S.   Morrill, was passed by  the National  congress by which  the State  is to  receive  the  further  sum  of  $15,000  annually,  this  sum  to  be  increased  $1,000  each  year  until  it  reaches $25,000. The spirit of these various acts of appropriation clearly is that these sums, amounting in all to $38,130, to be increased  as  above  to$48,130  annually,  shall  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  building  up  an  industrial  and agricultural school, where  those who desire  to engage  in agricultural or  industrial pursuits may obtain as nearly free  from  cost  as  possible,  a  higher  and more  distinctively  agricultural  or  industrial  training  than  can  be  had  at our ordinary schools. I  urge  upon  you  the  necessity  of  careful  and  earnest  consideration  of  the  needs  of  the  agricultural department  of  the  university.    In  seems  to  me  that  the  cause  of  Agriculture  in  Vermont  should  receive  a wonderful  impetus  from  the wise expenditure of  the munificent sums which will hereafter come  to us by virtue of these several grants. I know of no body of men more competent than the present legislature of Vermont, composed as it largely is of  practical  farmers  and  business  men,  to  consider  and  mature  wise  plans  calculated  to  secure  the  important ends  which  are  attainable  under  these  most  liberal  appropriations.  It  is  a  matter  which  should  receive  your immediate  and  careful  attention,  to  the  end  that  ample  discussion  may  be  had  before  the  hurry  of  the  closing days of the session shall divert your attention to matters of infinitely less importance. In  the development of any project, connected with  this  important  subject, even a  larger  sum  than will come to us under present grants is necessary, it should be remembered that legitimate and judicious expenditure in the cause  of  agricultural  education  is  wise  economy  in  a  State  like  Vermont,  whose  material  welfare  is  largely dependent upon its agricultural prosperity. I hope  that  in what  I have  said  I  shall not be understood  as  reflecting upon  the University of Vermont.  It  is an institution which stands deservedly high in the affections of every lover of higher education in our State, and to President Buckham  as  its  honored  head,  the State  is  in  large measure  indebted  for  its  high  standing  at  home and  abroad.  For  Professor  Cooke,  as  the  head  of  the  experiment  station,  I  have  received  from  leading agriculturalists,  with  whom  I  have  been  in  correspondence  and  consultation,  only  words  of  highest commendation for his thorough and conscientious devotion to the work he has in charge. EDUCATION The  school  law  of  1888  effected  a  radical  change  in  our  educational  system.  It  was  to  be  expected  that  in putting  the new machinery  in motion  there would be more or  less  friction. After  trial of but a  little more  than a year,  it  would  seem  unwise  to  pass  judgment  upon  the  practical  working  of  the  new  system,  or  to  hastily condemn a  law which  in  its general  features has proved so successful and beneficial  in other States. We cannot conceal  the  fact,  however,  that  in  many  portions  of  the  State  the  system  is  regarded  with  disfavor.  Its unpopularity undoubtedly grows out of the additional expense which it involves the effect of the law has been to raise the standard of qualifications and, as a result fewer teachers of the required standard have been obtainable, and  these  at  largely  increased wages. While  a  poor  teacher  at  any  price  is  undoubtedly  poor  economy,  still  the greater  increased  pay which  teachers  demand  under  the  new  law makes  a  burden which  falls  too  heavily  upon the  small  districts  in  our  agricultural  communities. A  tax  of  75  to  100  per  cent,  of  the  grand  list  for  the  port  of schools in addition to other taxation will not be cheerfully borne by any community. I  should  very  much  regret  however,  to  have  these  suggestions  construed  as  advocating  a  return  to  the  old system. Our present school  law  is, without question, a step  in  the right direction. While economy should be our watchword  in  most  branches  of  our  State  administration,  we  should  not  forget  that  reasonable  liberality  is  the only true economy in matters of such vital importance as that of education. Our schools are not better than they ought,  to  be;  but  such  an  adjustment  of  the  burden  of  their  support  should  be made,  as will  enable  the  poor  to enjoy  their  blessings  without  being  taxed  beyond  their  ability  to  bear.  The  law  as  it  now  stands  should  be  so amended as to still further equalize, the burdens of taxation for the support of schools in town where the district system  is  still  adhered  to. The  report of  the State  superintendent of education  is  full of valuable  suggestions on this  subject.  You  will:  also  have  for  your  guidance  the  reports  of  the  several  county  supervisors,  and  your legislative committees will get from consultation with the State superintendent and the county supervisors much valuable  information  touching  this matter,  In  this  connection  I  earnestly  urge  the  enactment  of  a  statute which shall  provide  for  the  furnishing  of  free  text-books.  I  know  of  no  single  item  of  expenditure,  which,  in  my judgment, would yield a greater measure of good for the limited outlay required. MILITIA . Your  attention  is  invited  to  the  biennial  report  of  the  quarter-master-general  and  the  adjutant  and  inspector general.  They  give  the  necessary  details  to  enable  you  to  judge  as  to  the  expenditures  required  to maintain  the militia.  There  can  be  no  question  that  the  condition  of  the  National  Guard  of  Vermont  has  been  materially improved during the past ten years, and now compares favorably with the favorite regiments in the larger states. The people of Vermont have reason to be proud of the organization, but just how far they are willing to go in its support is for you to decide. I make no recommendations. The question is rather one of State pride than of State necessity. The expense of militia for each biennial period during the past ten years has been as follows: $24,694 1881—2 ................................................................................................................................. 1883—4 ................................................................................................................................. 37,457 36,448 1885—6 ................................................................................................................................. 48,713 1887—8 ................................................................................................................................. 1889—90 ............................................................................................................................... 57,884 SAVINGS BANKS. You  will  have  before  you  the  report  of  the  inspector  of  finance,  giving  a  full  detailed  statement  of  the condition of each of  the  institutions under his charge,  together with valuable facts  touching  the workings of our savings  bank  laws.  The  information  which  he  gives  us,  “That  the  tendency  to  send money  west  and  south  has reached  its  climax,”  will  I  am  sure,  be  exceedingly  gratifying  to  you;  and  yet  we  are  confronted  with  the unpleasant  fact  that  the  investments  in  mortgages  out  of  the  State  have  increased  from  one  and  a  quarter millions  in  1879  to  seven  and  a  half millions  in  1890. The  inspector’s  suggestions  that  “Investments  in  foreign real estate certainly ought not to go beyond the limit now fixed by law,” meets my hearty approval, and I am of the  opinion  that  the  interests  of  the  State  as well  as  the  interests  of  the  depositor, would  be  better  subserved  if the  amount which  any  savings  bank  could  invest  in western mortgages was  limited  to  40  per  cent  of  the  entire assets  of  the  bank,  and  I  recommend  a  statute making  this  limit.  I  endorse  all  he  says with  reference  to  school savings, and hope some action may be taken to encourage thrift among the children of Vermont. I would call your special attention to his suggestions concerning the inspection of western land companies. I believe  the  law  of  1888,  making  the  examination  of  these  companies  a  duty  of  the  inspector,  has  not  resulted beneficially  to  our  State.  I  have  no  doubt  that  the  inspector  has  been  as  faithful  in  his  examination  of  these institutions  as  the  limited  time  at  his  disposal would  permit,  but  from  the  very  nature  of  the  case,  the  value  of these  brief  examinations  must  depend  largely  upon  the  integrity  of  the  officers  of  the  institutions  examined. Expert  bookkeeping  on  the  part  of  unscrupulous  officials  makes  it  possible  for  all  loan  companies,  both  good and bad, to come into our State armed with a certificate of good character from the inspector, and we have only to  examine  the  columns  of  the  State  press  to  see  how  quick  these  institutions  are  to  avail  themselves  of  this advantage. One western company advertises itself as “A banking corporation under the jurisdiction of inspector of finance of Vermont, and examined by him yearly,” and it is well known that the agents of  these corporations quite  generally  claim  this  for  their  institutions,  I  submit  that  the State  cannot  afford  to  stand  as  sponsor  for  the soundness of institutions over which it has no jurisdiction, and thereby open up new avenues through which the money of our people, so much needed to develop our industries at home, may find its way out of the State. The  savings  banks  and  trust  companies  of  Vermont  are  the  custodians  of  more  than  $19,000,000  of  the peoples’  money.  They  should  be  a  bulwark  against  financial  stringency  upon  which  our  people  may  securely rely,  and  the  tendency  to  a  smaller  measure  conservatism  in  carrying  actual  money  is  to  be  deprecated.  I recommend  the  passage  of  a  law  requiring  them  to  carry not  less  than  five per  cent of  their  assets  in  cash or  in some  approved  depository  in  Vermont,  New  York  or  Boston,  with  the  further  requirement  that  not  less  than one-half of this sum shall be carried in cash or in Vermont banks. RAILROAD COMMISSION. You will  read carefully  the  report of  this commission,  to  the end  that you my  judge as  to  the advisability of conferring upon it additional powers. While it is questionable whether the people of Vermont have received that substantial benefit from  this commission which was anticipated when  it was created, still I should regard  it as a step  backward  to  abolish  it.  I  believe  it  rather  to  be  your  duty  to  give  to  the  commission  a measure  of  vitality which it does not now possess. Its  expense  to  the State  is  something more  than $4,500 per year,  and unless  additional powers  and  a higher measure of  responsibility  is conferred,  I believe a  less expensive board will meet  the  requirements of  the State. Should  you,  conclude  to  enlarge  its  powers,  an  examination  of  the  report  will  suggest  to  you  the  direction  in which  such  enlargement  should  be made. For  instance,  touching upon  local passenger  fares,  they  speak  first of the  greatly  reduced  rates—two  cents  per  mile—afforded  to  many  citizens  of  the  State  by  the  purchase  of mileage  tickets  or  books,  and  then  add  as  follows:    “But  there  is  a  large  class  which  includes  those  who,  for want  of  pecuniary means,  and  for  other  good  and  sufficient  reasons,  are  unable  to  share  in  the  benefit  of  these reduced  rates,  but  are  compelled  to  buy  a  single  ticket  and  pay  therefor  three  to  four  and  one-half  cents  per mile—a  rate  of  fare  almost  equal  to  the  stage  coach  rates  of  fifty  years  ago.  It  is  needless,  perhaps,  to  remark that  this  latter  class  includes  all  who  are  the  least  able  to  pay.  It  (the  board)  entertains  the  hope  that  all  the railroad companies will see their way clear at an early day to make such reductions in local passenger rates as to remove this alleged inequality, and this in the interest of their patrons who are, for reasons above stated, unable to avail themselves of the present reductions.” The  point  may  be  raised  that  the  regulation  of  the  railroads  of  Vermont  should  not  be  in  the  hands  of  a commission,  but  experience  shows  that  the  practical  workings  of  a  law  permitting  the  commission  to  stand between  the  public  and  the  railroads  has  not  been  found  to  work  unjustly  in  those  States  in  which  the commission is clothed with power to give vitality to its suggestions. We confer upon these corporations valuable franchises, and in return they should extend to all the people of the State reasonable rates of  transportation; and I know of no more equitable manner of reaching an adjustment of  these matters  than  through  a  railroad  commission  clothed with  reasonable  powers  such  as  are  given  them  in many of the other States of the Union. RAILROAD PASSES. In February 1887,  the congress of  the United States passed what  is known as  the  inter-state commerce  law, which  provides  substantially  that  in  commerce  between  States,  railroads  shall  not  receive  from  any  person  or persons,  a  greater  or  less  compensation  for  the  transportation  of  passengers  or  property,  than  it  receives  from any other person or persons for the same service under similar conditions. The act is suitably guarded by proper exceptions. At  the  risk of quoting  too  liberally  the views of another,  I  take  from  the  first annual  report of  the  inter-state commerce  commission—  a  commission  including  among  others,  an  honored  son  of. Vermont, Hon. Aldace  F. Walker—giving  its views of  the  statute above  referred  to, after having observed  its workings. Speaking  first of favoritism in the transportation of freight, they then proceed in the following emphatic language: “The  evils  of  free  transportation  of  person  were  not  less  conspicuous  than  those  which  have  been mentioned,  concerning  freights.    This,  where  it  extended  beyond  the  persons  engaged  in  railroad  service,  was commonly  favoritism  in  a  most  unjust  and  offensive  form.    Free  transportation  was  given  not  only  to  secure business,  but  to  conciliate  the  favor  of  localities  and  of  public  bodies;  and,  while  it  was  often  demanded  by persons  who  had,  or  claimed  to  have,  influence  which  was  capable  of  being  made  use  of  the  prejudice  of  the railroad,  it was also accepted by public officers of  all grades  and of  all varieties of  service.    In  these  last  cases, the pass system was particularly obnoxious and baneful;  for  if any  return was  to be made or expected of public officers,  it  was  of  something  not  theirs  to  give,  but  which  belonged  to  the  public  or  to  constituents.    A  ticket entitling one  to free passes by rail was often more effective  in enlisting  the assistance and support of  the holder than  its value  in money would have been, and  in a great many cases  it would be  received  and  availed of, when the offer of money, made  to accomplish  the same end, would have been spurned as a bribe.   Much suspicion of public men  resulted, which was  sometimes  just, also  sometimes unjust and cruel; and  some deterioration of  the moral sense of  the community,  traceable  to  this cause, was unavoidable while the abuse continued.   The parties most frequently and largely favored, were those possessing large means and having large business interests. The general  fact came  to be,  that  in proportion  to  the distance  they were carried,  those able  to pay  the most paid  the  least.   One without means  had  seldom  any  grounds  on which  to  demand  free  transportation, while we wealth he was  likely  to have many grounds on which he  could make  it  for  the  interest of  the  railroad  company to  favor  him,  and  he  was  sometimes  favored  with  free  transportation  no  only  for  himself  and  family  but  for business  agents  also,  and  even  sometimes  for  his  customers.    The  demand  for  free  transportation  was  often  in the  nature  of  blackmail,  and  was  yielded  to  unwillingly,  and  through  fear  of  damaging  consequences  from  a refusal. But the evils were present as much when it was extorted as when freely given.” It  is  difficult  to  understand  why  the  provisions  of  the  inter-state  statute  above  referred  to  should  not  be adopted  in Vermont. But  it  is  unnecessary  that  I  add  to  the  arguments  of  the  inter-state  commerce  commission any of my own.  I have conferred with  the presidents of  the  leading  roads  in Vermont, and am assured  that with such  conditions  as  should  properly  be  made,  such  a  law  would  probably  meet  the  hearty  approval  of  every railroad  manager  in  the  State.  I  earnestly  hope  that  you  will  not  conclude  the  labors  of  this  session  without placing upon our statute books a law substantially that quoted from the United States statute. TEMPERANCE. An  attempt  will  be  made  at  the  present  session  to  disturb  the  long  established  policy  of  the  State  on  the question of temperance. I  do  not  deem  it  necessary  to  multiply  words  upon  this  subject.    The  people  of  Vermont  are  not  ready  to legalize the sale of intoxicating liquors in public saloons, and all legislation should be in harmony with this idea. If  you  find  the  present  law  defective,  correct  those  defects;  if  you  find  any  part  thereof  a  dead  letter  on  our statute  books,  repeal  it;  if  over-zealous  friends  of  temperance  have  secured  the  passage  of  laws  which  tend  to imperil the entire prohibitory system of our State, modify such provisions to the end that the law may more and more command the respect and support of all good citizens, never forgetting that the policy of prohibition is too firmly entrenched in the hearts of the great body of the common people, to allow your seriously entertaining any proposition of repeal.  My  predecessor  has  devoted  to  this  subject  a  vast  amount  of  thought,  and  has  given  you  in  his  retiring message  the  results  of  his  labors.  I  heartily  endorse  his  recommendations,  based  as  they  are  upon  an  extensive experience in liquor prosecutions and coming as they do from one whose warm interest in all matters pertaining to temperance entitles him to voice the sentiments of its friends in Vermont. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. The senate may make proposals of amendment to the constitution at the present session. Changes  in  the  constitution  should  be  made  only  when  the  public  good  clearly  requires  it.  The  practice  now prevalent  in  most  of  the  States  of  holding  the  freeman’s  meeting  on  the  first  Tuesday  in  November  and  the general  assembly  the  winter  following  has  strong  arguments  in  its  favor.  It  would  obviate  the  necessity  of  an additional  election  every  presidential  year,  and  bring  the  session  of  our  legislature  at  a  time  when  our  farmers have greater leisure than at the busy time of harvest. Unless some objection which does not now occur to me can be urged against the change, it seems to me that the good of the State would be better subserved by conforming to the general custom. CENTENNIAL OF VERMONT’S ADMISSION TO THE UNION. Our  State  was  the  first  to  be  added  to  the  original  thirteen,  and  the  one  hundredth  anniversary  of  her admission to the Union on the fourth day of March next.  It will be for you to say in what manner event shall be celebrated.  Until  recently  it  has  been  understood  that  the  Bennington  battle  monument  would  be  dedicated  in 1891  and  it has been  suggested  that  if you deemed  it  expedient,  the  centennial  anniversary might be  celebrated at the same time  A prominent member of the monument association has recently advised me, however, that the monument  is  so  far  incomplete  that  its  dedication  the  coming  year  may  not  be  thought  advisable.  I  will  not therefore make any recommendation at this time but presume that before the close of the session the monument association will offer definite plans for your consideration. AUSTRALIAN BALLOT SYSTEM. The  privilege  of  every  voter  to  cast  his  ballot  without  fear,  and  subject  to  no  improper  influence  or espionage  is  one  of  the  most  sacred  rights  of  American  citizenship.    That  the  Australian  system  protects  this right  of  the  voter  more  fully  than  any  other  yet  suggested,  is  conceded.    Wherever  it  has  been  tried  it  has become  popular.    The  only  important  objection  t  its  adoption,  that  I  have  heard  expressed,  is  that  of  expense.  For  the  purpose  of  carefully  investigating  this  objection,  I  have  corresponded  with  the  smaller  towns  in Massachusetts where  the  law  is  in  operation  and  learn  that  the  cost  is  too  small  to  be worthy  of  consideration, being from five dollars to twenty dollars in places corresponding in population to the large majority of Vermont towns. Vermont  cannot  afford  to  be  tardy  in  the  adoption  of  any  system  having  for  its  end  a  purer  ballot,  and believing that no better method has yet been devised to accomplish this, I earnestly urge its adoption. COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURAL AND MANUFACTURING INTERESTS. You  will  have  before  you  the  report  of  the  commissioner,  in  which  is  given  an  exhaustive  survey  of  that most  important  subject,  the  re-occupation  of  our  unoccupied  farms.  Governor  Dillingham  has  given  much attention to the working of this commission, and devotes a large part of his retiring message thereto. For the purpose of informing myself as to the class of people who are being brought to Vermont through the exertions  of  the  commissioner,  and  the  character  of  the  farms  they  are  occupying,  I  visited  the  Swedish settlements  at Wilmington  and Weston  and while  anything  I might  add  to what  has  already  been  given  you  on this  topic,  by  the  governor  and  the  commissioner,  would  be  unnecessary  repetition,  I  wish  to  emphasize  what they have said in two important particulars. First, There  is,  in my opinion, no better  class of men  coming  to us  from  foreign  countries  than  the Swedes. They  are  intelligent,  fairly  educated;  frugal,  industrious  and  honest.  In  a word  they  are  just  the material  out  of which desirable citizens are made. Second, it is clearly for the interest of Vermont that we induce these people to come to our State, and locate upon our unoccupied farming land if it can be done without unreasonable expense. I  believe  the  commissioner  has  given  to  the  performance  of  the  important  and  arduous  duties  devolving upon  him,  a  measure  of  energy  and  conscientious  devotion  which  few  men  would  have  bestowed  upon  it.  He has been animated from the first, as it seems to me, by a desire to perform a patriotic duty.  It only  remains  to  add,  that  the  entire  scheme  is  an  experiment,  the  success or  failure of which,  it  is yet  too early to predict.  Whether  these Swedes will  cling  to  their  farms,  and by  their  success  thereon,  attract others  to our State, or, failing of success, shall desert the lands they have purchased, and go to other fields, time only will determine. I  am  inclined,  after  a  somewhat  careful  survey  of  the  field,  to  recommend  a moderate  appropriation  for  the continuance of the commission another two years. THE WORLD’S FAIR, The  four  hundredth  anniversary  of  the  discovery  of  America  by  Columbus,  which  is  to  be  celebrated  by  a world’s  fair  Chicago  in  1893,  may  require  some  action  on  the  part  of  this  Legislature.  Dr.  H.  H. McIntyre,  of West  Randolph,  and  Hon.  B.  B.  Smalley,  of  Burlington,  have  been  appointed  commissioners  for  Vermont  by Governor  Dillingham.  They  have  recently  returned  from  Chicago,  and  will  undoubtedly  lay  before  you  plans enabling you to give the matter intelligent consideration a prominent sheep breeder In Vermont informs me that no  proper  representation  of  this  industry  can  be  made,  without  at  least  a  year’s  preparation,  and  strenuously urges action at this session. Very likely exhibitors of stock of other kinds may take the same view of the matter. I  believe  some  action  should  be  taken  by  you  at  this  session  to  the  end  that  our  State  may  be  creditably represented at the exposition. WEEKLY PAYMENTS. Observation and experience confirm me in the conviction, that both corporations and individuals employing help  in  large numbers, should pay  their employees weekly and  in money; and  if demanded by  the  laboring men of  the  State,  I  believe  it  is  your  duty  to  grant  them  statutory  protection  with  reference  to  time  and  manner  of payment, similar to that in force in neighbor states. The employees in most of the manufacturing establishments of the State are so liberally treated that, although not paid weekly, they are nevertheless satisfied and express no desire for  legislative action  in  their be half. I have not been able  to make sufficient  investigation  to fully satisfy myself as to the extent of the abuses claimed to be practiced upon employees in this particular. No one can have better information touching this subject than you who come direct from the people. You will take such steps touching these matters as you may deem wise. Your action should not be hasty, nor should  you  unnecessarily  interfere with  the  business  arrangements  of  our manufacturers,  unless  you  find  a  real abuse, and one that is so generally prevalent as to demand relief at your hands. TEN HOUR LAW The  most  of  the  New  England  States  have  found  it  advisable  for  the  protection  of  operatives  in  their manufactories  to  pass  a  law  regulating  the  hours  of  labor.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  drift  of  public sentiment  is  strongly  in  favor  of  the  enactment  of  laws  to  improve  the  condition  of  the  laboring  classes,  and  I recommend as a step in the right direction, that a law be enacted prohibiting the working of females and, minors for manufacturing corporations, more  than  ten hours per day. I have corresponded with  the managers of several of  the  large manufactories  in New Hampshire, where  a  statute,  applicable  to  all mill  operatives without  regard to  age  or  sex,  has  been  in  operation  two  years  or more,  and  the  replies  are  uniformly  to  the  effect  that  the  law works no injury to the manufacturer. FORESTY. New  Hampshire  is  solving  the  problem  of  deserted  farms  by  attracting  from  the  large  cities  those  who would  make  their  summer  homes  upon  her  hillsides.  Vermont  may  well  follow  her  example  and  by  planting trees  along  our  highways  and  in  our  villages  add  largely,  not  only  to  our  own  comfort,  but  to  the  general attractiveness  of  the  State.  Another  important  feature  of  the  subject  of  forestry  which  will  press  upon  us  for consideration within a few years, is the wholesale destruction of our forests now going on. Serious injury to the physical  interests of  the State will eventually  result  therefrom, and  I know of no  subject of  so great  importance to the State, which receives so little attention. REVISION OF THE LAWS. It  has  been  the  policy  of  the  State  for  sometime  to  make  a  revision  and  compilation  of  the  statutes  at  the beginning of every decade. It will be incumbent on you to make provision for this work.  UNITED STATES SENATOR It will be your duty on the second Tuesday of the session to elect a United States senator for six years, from the fourth of March next. CONCLUSION. Again  I  would  impress  upon  you  the  importance  of  the  work  at  hand,  and  urge  the  necessity  of  taking  up this work at once and pursuing it diligently to the end. We come here as the representatives of the people, whose servants we are, and who may rightfully look to us to bring to the discharge of our duties here that same degree of industry and careful consideration which we would devote to our own private affairs.
