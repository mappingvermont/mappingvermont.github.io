Executive  Speech of  Jonas Galusha  As it appears in the  RECORDS  OF THE  GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL  OF THE  STATE OF VERMONT.  Volume VI.  1819      October, 15, 1819. SPEECH OF GOV. GALUSHA– 18191.  Gentlemen of  the Council, and Gentlemen of  the General Assembly, – It  is with pleasure  that  I meet you on the  present  occasion,  at  a  time  of  so  general  prosperity,  when  not  only  our  own  state  and  country,  but  the nations of Europe, share liberally of the blessings of Providence.  The last season has been peculiarly propitious, and the earth has yielded her increase in great abundance.  It is also a subject of the most pleasing consideration, that our dear bought  rights  and privileges  remain  secure, and our  laboring citizens yet  reap  the  rewards of  their own  industry;  and  that  peace  and  a  good  understanding  continues  between  us  and  the  nations  with  whom  we have  any  considerable  intercourse.    Although  some  apprehension  exists,  that  the  arrangements  with  Spain,  so happily  concluded  with  their  minister,  will  not  be  ratified  on  the  part  of  the  Spanish  government,  yet  we entertain a hope, that further reflection will enable them to judge more correctly of their own interest, and put an end  to  the  long  existing  disputes  between  the  two  governments,  and  settle  a  boundary  line, which will  prevent all danger of future disturbances.  While we enjoy a rich variety of distinguished favors we ought to reflect on them with gratitude, and render the most unfeigned praise  to Him who  so  liberally bestows on us his  richest blessings.   Permit me, Gentlemen, to enquire,  that while we enjoy all  the means of wealth and happiness, so general a complaint of  the scarcity of circulating medium, and the consequent distress of individuals, in discharging their private debts, and managing their  own  concerns,  prevails?   For  a  people  possessing  a  rich  and  extensive  territory,  abounding with  the  fruits and  productions  of  almost  every  clime;  with  an  unshackled  commerce  throughout  the  habitable  world; possessing genius and enterprise exceeded by no other people on earth,  to be  in distress  for want of a sufficient portion of [circulating] medium, is a subject that calls loudly for investigation and reform.  Amongst the various causes, the want of economy, in my opinion, is the most prominent.   The unlimited credit given in this country, in  almost  every  branch  of  business,  to  say  nothing  of  the  banks,  proves  the  ruin  of  too many  valuable  citizens, of  every  class  and  profession  in  society.    The  frequent  bankruptcies,  suspensions,  and  commitments  to  county jails,  sufficiently  prove  the  fact.    I  am  sensible  that  this  great  and  growing  evil  cannot  be  wholly  remedied  by acts  of  legislation;  yet  I  am  persuaded,  that  every  wise  and  virtuous  legislature  will  study  and  promote economy, whenever it is consistent with justice, and that benevolence which is due to our fellow creatures. Suffer me, Gentlemen,  to  submit  for  your  consideration,  the  propriety  of  passing  a  law  freeing  the  body  of debtors  from  arrest  and  imprisonment on debts of  a  small  amount, which may be  contracted  after  a given  time, in  future.    I  am  of  opinion,  that  more  property  is  spent  in  collecting  small  debts  by  law,  especially  when  the body  is  taken  in  execution  ,  than  the  amount  of  debts  saved  by  such  collection.    I  also  believe  that  it  would discourage  credit  where  it  ought  not  to  be  given,  and  produce  punctuality  in  those  who  obtain  it;  yet  the  only safe  remedy  against  embarrassment  or  poverty,  is  a  retrenchment  of  family  expenses,  and  lessening  the consumption  of  articles  of  foreign  growth  and  manufacture.    Much  may  be  done  by  encouraging  home manufactures  by  legislative  provisions;  but  the  most  powerful  of  all  means  is  that  of  example.    Let  but  one influential  citizen  from  each  town  in  this  state,  return  from  this  legislature  to  his  constituents,  with  a  rigid determination  to  abandon  the unnecessary use of  foreign  articles,  and while he  enjoys  all  the  real  comforts  and actual  conveniences  of  life,  reject  everything  that  is  superfluous;  his  fellow  citizens  would  soon  emulate  his example  and  exhibit  an  improved  state  of  society.    General  information  is  indispensably  necessary  to  the preservation  of  a  free  republican  government;  but  this  cannot  be  retained  if  the  great  body  of  the  people, through want of economy,  indulge  their propensities  in  the use of  superfluities, and become poor and unable  to educate  their children.   The patronage of  the wealthy will never be extended  indiscriminately  to  the children of the whole community.  Even that source will diminish where extravagance prevails. If  I  am  not  mistaken,  in  those  states  where  the  banks  are  the  most  numerous,  and  the  means  of  credit  the most  easy,  the  recent  cry  of  scarcity  of  medium,  and  its  consequent  distresses,  have  been  the  most  heard  and felt.   This, Gentlemen, deserves  some attention,  if petitions  to  increase  the number of banks  in  this  state  should                                                  1 From the printed Assembly Journal of 1819, corrected.  be preferred.  Although I wish equal privileges to be extended to every part of the state, yet I am confident that a multiplicity of incorporated banks in a state will prove injurious to the community if ruinous to each other. Incompliance  with  the  constitution  of  this  state,  a  Council  of  Censors  must  be  chosen,  on  the  last Wednesday of March next; it therefore becomes necessary for the General Assembly, at their present session to pass a law regulating the choice of said Council, and appointing a place for their first meeting. It will be  requisite  to  elect  a number of  trustees of  the University of Vermont,  to  fill  the vacancies of  those whose times [terms] of office will expire on the last day of November next.  I would likewise further suggest for your consideration,  the propriety of granting some further pecuniary aid  to  the University,  in order  to enable  its officers  to  render  it  eminently  useful,  and  truly  honorable  to  the  state;  at  least  until  the  land  granted  or sequestered, for that purpose can be leased and produce that revenue to the University, which was expected, and which, I hope, will soon be realized. The act for ascertaining certain claims of this state against the United States, and for obtaining the same, has been duly attended to, but has not yet been decided on.   It was late in the last session of Congress before all the necessary papers could be  forwarded, agreeable  to  [the]  information  received  from our  representatives,  relative to the evidence that would be wanted to substantiate the claims.  The papers now lie with the third auditor in the treasury department, for adjustment.  I expect a settlement soon after our representative arrive at Washington, at the next session, if it is not before. I am informed by Lt. Bangs of the U.S. Ordnance department, at Vergennes, that he has been directed by the senior  officer  of  that  department  to  deliver  to  the  executive  of  this  state,  six  hundred  and  seventeen  stands  of arms;  being  a  part  of  this  state’s  proportion,  under  the  law  of  the  United  States  approved  April  23d,  1808, making provision  for arming  the whole body of  the militia of  the United States.   The arms are  to be distributed to the militia, under such rules and regulations as shall be, by law, prescribed by the legislature of each state and territory.    The  General  Assembly  will,  therefore,  make  such  order  relative  to  the  disposition  of  said  arms,  as they  judge  most  expedient.    Lt.  Bangs  will  deliver  the  arms  at  any  place  in  this  state,  where  they  can  be transported by water; but is not authorized to remove them to any place by land carriage. All communications  that have been made  to me, during  the recess of  the  legislature, will be  the subject of a special message, and seasonably communicated. I  cannot, Gentlemen,  close  this  address, without  expressing  to  you,  and  through  you  to  the  freemen  of  this state, the grateful sense I entertain of the honour bestowed on me in electing me to the office of chief magistrate of this state. The repeated assurance of their confidence has added new obligations to improve my feeble ability in  promoting  their  best  interests.    Not  withstanding  I  have  labored  under  many  disadvantages,  yet  I  have  the approbation  of my  conscience,  that  I  have  endeavored  to  be  faithful,  and  that  I  have  never  suffered  by  private interest  to  interfere with my  public  duties.   And,  if  errors  have  been  committed,  I  entreat my  fellow  citizens  to cast  over  my  failings  the  mantle  of  charity,  and  consider  them  errors  in  judgment  and  not  in  design.    I  have always  thought  it  wrong  in  a  republican  government,  to  make  too  frequent  changes  of  men  in  office,  lest  it check  that  laudable ambition  to acquire  that knowledge which  is necessary  to discharge  the duties of  the office with honour to themselves, and for the best good of the state.  But I consider it an equal, if not a greater error, to continue any persons in the most important office in the state, for such a length of time as to encourage them to conceive  that  they  ought  to  hold  their  offices  by  prescription,  and  lose  that  sense  of  that  responsibility  to  their constituents  that  every  officer  in  a  free  government  ought  at  all  times  to  feel;  nor  until  old  age  imperceptibly steals  upon  them,  and  renders  them  less  adequate  to  perform  the  duties  of  their  office,  than  they  themselves imagine. From these considerations, and from the great desire I have to spend the residue of my life in domestic retirement, I recommend to the freemen of the state to unite on some other person to perform the duties of chief magistrate, after the expiration of the term for which I have been recently elected.   Yet be assured, that my zeal for  the  public  good  will  never  cease  but  with  my  reason  or  my  life.    I  hope  thro’  the  aid  of  an  indulgent Providence  and  your  kind  support,  to  be  able  to  discharge  the  duties  of  my  office  to  acceptance  during  the present year, and, at the close of the same, to have the pleasure of bidding you a friendly farewell.
