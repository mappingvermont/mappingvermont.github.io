Inaugural Address  of  Richard A. Snelling   as it appears in the   JOURNAL  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY   BIENNIAL SESSION  1983 Thursday, January 6, 1983 Inaugural Address  Mr.  President,  Mr.  Speaker,  Mr.  President  pro  tempore,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  distinguished  officials  and servants of Vermont, guests and friends: For  generations,  we  and  the  people  throughout  our  nation  have  spoken  of  and  valued  the  independence  of Vermont and her people. We cherish our heritage of independence and strive to act so that over time we too will be judged as having contributed to the preservation of that treasured heritage. Today’s  problems  call  upon  us  to  examine  closely  the  stuff  of  which  independence  is  made.  As  we  study history we  recognize  that  those who  settled  these  fierce  hills understood  that  independence  is not only  the  fruit of hard work,  but  also of  careful planning.   They knew  that  to be  independent  requires  the  acceptance of  some special responsibilities for the present and some special risks in building for the future. Time has not changed those requirements even though the complexities of a highly specialized society make the realistic definitions and goals of independence quite different from those of earlier days. Clearly,  in 1983  if we  are  to  seek  the values of  independence  in  the  circumstances of  this century, we must understand first, which elements of our quality of life are under our control and which are largely determined by national circumstances. I am convinced this nation has begun, though only begun, the monumental task of repairing serious damage to  its  fundamental  economic  capacity.    In  the  end,  the  American  dream  of  justice  and  opportunity  for  all depends  upon  an  economic  system  capable  of meeting  the  reasonable  needs  of  all. A  determination  to  restrain public  expenditures,  and  to  reduce  tax  burdens  will,  if  compassionately  designed  so  as  to  justify  increasing public  support over a  long period of  time, be of great benefit  to  the nation. The dramatic  reduction  in  inflation, from more than 14% to less than 6% within the last year, is an important harbinger of a return to economic well-being. In  time, restored faith  in  the  integrity of currency and  the wisdom of private savings and  investment will result  in  interest  rates affordable  to consumers needing housing and other major  tangible goods,  and  affordable also to manufacturers whose investments are required to assure adequate capacity and efficiency of the nation’s economic engine. The  nation  has  been  in  deep  recession  for  more  than  a  year.  In  many  communities  throughout  the  United States,  unemployment  has  affected  20  per  cent  of  the  work  force.  Vermont,  thus  far,  has  escaped  the  worst ravages of these times of economic tumult. Our unemployment rate is a little more than half the national figure. But  for  individual  Vermonters  —  those  who  are  experiencing  the  dislocation  of  our  national  transition--the recession  is,  painfully,  much  more  than  a  mathematical  definition.  We  can  be  grateful,  though,  that  this legislature  and  those  of  the  immediate  past,  were  attentive  to  the  cultivation  of  our  economic  capacity. Together, we and concerned citizens from across our state, have invested our energies in economic development on  a  state,  regional  and  local  basis.    Those  efforts  are  saving  Vermont  from  sharing  the  worst  of  the  current unpleasant national circumstances. The  vast  majority  of  Vermonters  remain  in  a  position  to  meet  the  needs  of  their  own  families  and  to contribute reasonable amounts to assist those of their neighbors in need. We can be grateful that the revenues of this state disappoint us because they have not grown more rapidly, rather than because they have decreased. We  are weathering  the  truth  that  our  financial  capacity  as  a  state  is  being  dramatically  affected  by  both  the national circumstances and by  the  federal government’s  remedy. The principal  tool  that  the  federal government is using to fight inflation and to provide for increased capital investments in this country is the enactment of tax cuts. Vermont  lost  state  revenues of 24 million dollars  in  the  last  two years because  the Vermont  income  tax  is determined as a percentage of  the  federal  tax obligation.  In  the current  fiscal year alone, Vermont’s  income  tax revenues  will  be  fourteen  million  dollars  less  than  they  would  have  been  had  the  federal  government  not enacted  those  tax  cuts.  Under  these  circumstances,  even  after  providing  for  a  rescission  of  4.3  million  dollars from  the  level  appropriated  last  year,  our  expected  revenues  will  not  fully  match  approved  expenditures.  We will  probably  end  this  year  with  a  deficit  in  the  order  of  eight  to  ten  million  dollars. We  have  a  duty  to  make responsible plans to liquidate that deficit promptly. But as we determine how best to do that, a sense of perspective is in order to understand our true capacity — not just for the short term, but for the long term. It is imperative that we continue to meet the current needs of Vermonters in these difficult times and equally imperative  that  we  continue  to  look  to  the  needs  of  the  future.  It  should  be  comforting  that  we  approach  that responsibility at the end, not the beginning, of national recession. Next week I will present a budget which will address  the problem  in detail, meeting  the challenge squarely, but  at  the  same  time  recognizing  that our  concern  is  for  the  future,  rather  than with  the past.  It  is no  secret  that the  economic  engine  which  drives  state  tax  revenues  has  been  impaired  in  the  last  year.  Planning  for  stability and  orderliness  requires  us  to  recognize  the  historical  evidence  that  the  fiscal  year  following  the  end  of recession tends to be a year of very dramatic increases in state revenues. It is fresh in my memory, as it no doubt is  in  the  minds  of  many  in  this  room  that  the  deficit  of  1975  was  used  to  justify  both  demands  for  substantial permanent  tax  increases  and  serious  cut-backs  in  essential  programs  of  public  service,  but  that  Vermont subsequently ended fiscal year 1977 with a record nineteen million dollar surplus. I  know  of  no  way  to  cure  a  deficit  this  year  without  impairing  the  necessary  capacity  to  meet  fairly  our current obligations and prudent plans or the future. I do suggest, however, that settling for a slightly smaller tax cut  than  might  otherwise  be  available  seems  like  a  mild  price  to  pay  for  the  assurance  of  fiscal  integrity.  The method  would  be  to  raise  by  one  percent,  for  one  year,  the  rate  at  which  we  tax  Vermont  incomes  as  a percentage of the federal income tax obligation. So limiting the unplanned Vermont tax cut in fiscal 1984 to six million dollars instead of fourteen million dollars, we will cure the deficit in the first year of the new biennium, and at the same time assure adequate funds to meet present and future needs. To do so will not increase taxes. In fact,  we  will  have  once  again  reduced  the  portion  of  Vermonters’  incomes  which  are  taken  by  Vermont  for general  fund  taxes.  A  Vermonter  who  paid  $100  in  state  income  taxes  in  1976,  paid  $75  on  the  same  income this year, and would pay only $69.44 on that same income next year at the temporary rate I propose. I am saying we do have  the capacity  to meet our  responsibilities. Clearly, however,  that assumes a  thoughtful sorting out of both our priorities and our needs. We face no crisis, but we do have solemn and difficult duties. Fortunately, we have both the will and the resources to meet those duties. I  believe  our  mission  in  this  biennium  is  to  assign  our  capacity  judiciously  as  between  present  needs  and future goals. First,  let  me  address  that  category,  that  group  of  things  we  should  do  because  they  are  necessary  to  meet urgent, immediate needs. As  a  significant  priority  in  this  category  I  am  recommending  to  you  a  proposal  which  addresses  our immediate  obligation  to  many  unemployed  Vermonters.  We  must  accept  such  an  obligation  not  only  out  of moral duty, but because  it  is  also  clearly  in  the overall  interests of  the  state  to  retain  this great human  resource of skill and productivity as a valuable asset for our future growth. There  are  two  groups  of Vermonters who,  unless we  act,  are  likely  to  suffer  the  agonies  of  unemployment even  as  their  neighbors  enjoy  the  fruits  of  present  jobs  and  of  the  expected  economic  recovery. They  are  those who  live  in  certain  areas  of  Vermont  where  unemployment  has  stubbornly  resisted  state  and  local  efforts  at development  for  decades  and  those  who  were,  until  recently,  employed  in  industries  suffering  from  special cyclical problems not likely to vanish in the first year or two of national recovery. In  responding  to  the  short-term  needs  of  the  recently  unemployed,  I  suggest  to  you  that  we  establish  a vehicle  to  apply  their  skills  to  meeting  long-term  state  requirements  for  enhancing  and  preserving  publicly-owned, vital capital assets. Our forests need thinning to increase the growth of fiber and the value of the timber. Our  parks  will  be  more  valuable  and  attract  more  visitors  in  the  future  if  we  improve  them,  and  start  now  an integrated  network  of  multi-use  trails  to  further  enhance  Vermont’s  allure  for  all  who  like  to  hike  and  ride. Better  weather-proofing  and  insulation  of  our  state  buildings  will  pay  for  itself  in  the  savings  of  fuel,  yet  past limits  on  available  bonding  funds  have  forced  us  to  continue  wasting  both  dollars  and  energy.  As  you  know, thousands of miles of state  roads need maintenance  to preserve  the  investments we have already made  in  them. The work required is labor intensive. Our  task  is  to  match  resource  with  need.  We  have  Vermonters  who  have  demonstrated  skills  and  a preference for honest accomplishment over welfare. At the same time, the people of this state own capital assets which will become more valuable upon the application of labor. This is a good time to bring the two together. I will  present  you  with  a  proposal  for  a  special  $5  million  bond  authorization  to  finance  a  “Vermont  Futures” program  to  accomplish  this. Clearly,  such  bonding  ought  to  be  in  addition  to  any  formula  limit  this  legislature sets on routine bonding. In the last six years the debt of the State of Vermont has fallen to about half of its prior level, measured in comparison to annual personal income. A  second  immediate  priority  is  a  group  of  non-literate  adult  Vermonters  who  urgently  need  functional literacy  skills  as  a  basic  prerequisite  to  economic  and  social  self-sufficiency.  They  cannot  be  independent because  they  cannot  communicate  with  their  fellow  Vermonters,  or  with  prospective  employers  with  written words  or  simple  arithmetic  concepts.  Using  methods  which  have  become  national  and  international  models  of efficiency  and  effectiveness,  five  thousand  Vermont  adults  in  1982  gained  their  literacy  at  an  average  cost  of $156.20 per person. As we have become  increasingly aware of  the need  to bridge  the gap between  literacy and jobs  we  have  the  obligation  to  guarantee  all  adults  who  will  make  the  effort  an  opportunity  to  gain  the  basic skills which they need to improve their lives. It is surprising that a program which has so much effect at so little cost per person operates at only about half the level needed to get ahead of illiteracy in Vermont. Another urgent concern of many Vermonters is the rising cost of health care. This cost has put a tremendous strain  on  our  medical  assistance  programs  and  on  individual  citizens  and  employers  through  higher  insurance premiums. We must develop a system that makes adequate care available, but at reasonable and affordable cost.  From  the  work  of  my  Commission  on  Cost  Containment,  we  will  propose  legislation  establishing  an  annual ceiling  on  hospital  expenditures.  This  “maxicap”  will  be  negotiated  by  key  parties—including  hospitals, employers, Blue Cross/ Blue  Shield  and  the  state—and will  reflect  the  realistic  needs  of Vermonters. This  is  a complex  problem,  but  the  direction  we  will  propose  is  likely  to  make  a  start  toward  reducing  the  runaway financial burden, while insuring quality health care. Action  taken  by  recent  legislatures  has  already  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  tough  enforcement  of  our DWI  law. But measures  in  practice  are  simply  not  adequate  to  the  scope  of  the  problem! We must  do more  to get drunk drivers off our  roads!  It  is of  utmost  importance  that  those who drive while  impaired know  that  they will  be  caught  and  punished  appropriately.  Legislation  is  required  to  assure  that  first-time  DWI  violators quickly lose the privilege of driving. Quick suspension, through a civil proceeding, has been proven to be one of the most effective deterrents, and processing first-time DWI offenses through civil courts will greatly reduce the time required to remove these violators from the road. I  will  be  also  asking  for  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  state  troopers.  Although  increased  law enforcement  capacity  is  clearly  needed  to  meet  a  wide  range  of  threats  to  the  security  of  our  persons  and property,  I believe  the  additional  cost of  a  strengthened  state police would be  justified  alone by  the  removal of more drunks from our roads. As the state and federal governments have grown increasingly interdependent, so have the relations between state  and  localities  become  more  intertwined.  Domestic  issues  have  both  local  and  statewide  dimensions:  for example, taxation, environmental quality, police protection, streets and roads, and sanitation. The time has come to  address  these  intergovernmental  matters  directly,  cooperatively,  and  on  a  continuing  basis  through  a  joint state-local-civic undertaking  to help our  citizen  leaders  in  a professional,  advisory way. We need  to  establish  a Vermont  Advisory  Commission  on  Intergovernmental  Relations,  patterned  on  the  successful  national counterpart. Within  the  last  year  we  have  heard  a  growing  clamor  for  higher  state  taxes  to  fund  increased  aid  to  local communities. Vermont already appropriates a larger share of general fund revenues to local services than all but a handful of states. If those distributions do not provide justice to the people of the communities of the state, we should  deliberate  together  about  the  entire  state/local  relationship  before  establishing  huge  new  claims  on  our general fund. Another  urgent  charge  of  this  Commission  would  be  to  improve  the  complex  procedures  through  which Vermont  administers  growth  management.  I  propose  development  of  a  prudent  program  of  coordination  and localization for the growth-permit system to eliminate redundancy and, where feasible, to decentralize decision-making.  Projects  of  statewide  or  regional  significance  will  remain  direct  state  concerns,  and  technical  and financial  assistance  will  be  provided  to  guarantee  local  administrative  and  professional  competence.  Such  a program  will  return  decision-making  to  local  governments  when  sensible,  eliminate  unnecessary  procedural overlapping,  and  yet  retain  Vermont’s  unshakable  commitment  to  high  environmental,  health,  and  safety standards. Protection  of  the  people’s  billions  invested  in  our  roads  is  an  urgent  priority.  We  must  proceed  with  the second year of Vermont’s  five-year-catch-up  repaving program. There are still over 700 miles of state highway that are in critical need of repair. We cannot afford to be diverted from this commitment. Further neglect of our multi-billion dollar capital asset would compound  the future costs of repair. Unfortunately,  the recently enacted federal legislation will not substantially assist this effort. I will be presenting a budget which reflects Vermont’s priorities  to  continue  our  repaving  program.  Funding  of  this  project  will  require  an  increase  in  Vermont’s  gas tax and other highway user fees. Without good roads, Vermonters cannot have that mobility which is an integral part of independence in today’s world. Over  ten  years  ago  I  was  a  leader  on  the  floor  of  this  House  in  urging  that  Vermont  ratify  the  proposed federal  equal  rights  amendment.  I  am  proud  that Vermont was  among  the  first  states  to  do  so. While  I  remain firm  in  my  belief  that  we  must  have  such  an  amendment,  I  believe  it  is  now  appropriate  to  adopt  a  Vermont Equal  Rights  Amendment  to  assure  the  rights  of  all  of  Vermont’s  citizens —  both  female  and  male.  I  believe justice requires us to see such action as a priority. In  times  of  difficult  decisions  it  is  tempting  for  legislative  bodies  to  avoid  new  ideas—even  when  no appropriation  is  involved--and  to allocate available  funds entirely  to old programs. Such a policy makes people prisoners of  the status quo. It dooms  them  to facing  later crises, which might have been avoided and  to funding service programs which otherwise might not have been necessary. Let us avoid such temptations. Vermont’s  strength  is  in  large  part  a  result  of  our willingness  to  look  ahead  and  to  act  early  in  areas where such actions can bring our future more under our control. Vermont  is  its people. It  is  incumbent on us  to prepare Vermonters for  the challenges of  the future. Steps  to better achieve that goal are always timely. The  last  general  assembly  put  in  place  what  I  believe  is  an  essential  foundation  upon  which  we  can  now build  one  of  the  best  public  school  systems  in  America.  At  long  last,  we  have  a  fair  method  of  aiding communities  so  that  the  state’s  resources  augment  those  communities  that  have  educational  responsibilities which are beyond their fiscal capabilities. Classroom  teachers  have  long  understood  that  education  in  the  early  years  determines  the  capacity  and  the rate  of  learning  in  later  years,  and  the  self-sufficiency  of  students  in  pursuing  further  knowledge.  It  is  self-evident that first children learn to read that they may thereafter read to learn. Research data clearly indicates that carefully designed educational programs for children from age 3 through grade  3  can  have  enormous  long-term  benefits,  not  only  in  improving  academic  performance  but  also  in reducing  the need  for programs designed  to compensate  for  learning deficiencies. We  should  strive  for  the best educated young students in this country. To accomplish this, I am proposing an early education initiative which will enable local school districts to develop effective and innovative programs involving not only educators, but also  parents,  community  volunteers,  and  businesses.  These  programs  will  include  early  screening,  pre-school education,  intensified  instruction  in  math,  reading  and  writing,  and  much  greater  exposure  to  the  arts  and  our cultural  heritage.  Obviously  an  initiative  of  this  significance  cannot  be  accomplished  overnight,  so  we  will propose several start-up programs in fiscal year 1984 and continue progress from there in the following year. One of the most pervasive and basic problems of our society is the abuse of alcohol. Alcohol is a significant factor  in  chronic  unemployment,  in  the  majority  of  all  crimes  against  people,  and  in  the  majority  of  suicides, drownings  and  fatal  accidents. Any  progress  that  can  be made  in  combating  alcohol  abuse will  affect  the  lives of  thousands  of  Vermont  families.  History  illustrates  clearly  the  failure  to  reduce  that  problem  in  any meaningful way  by  legislating  prohibition  for  all  or  any  part  of  the  population.   We  need  to make  our  citizens aware  of  the  insidious  dangers  of  alcohol  through  a  comprehensive  alcohol  education  effort  beginning  in  our elementary  schools  and  continuing  through  high  school  and  into  the  adult  community.    I  am  creating  a  special cabinet  task  force, chaired by Human Services Secretary Lloyd Novick,  to  review  the  state’s many and diverse educational and  treatment programs,  in order  to  recommend ways  to make  these programs more  effective. One certain  recommendation  will  be  that  all  state-approved  driver  education  programs  include  a  comprehensive segment on the effects of alcohol use on driving ability and safety. To  have  a  healthy  economy  tomorrow,  advancing  further  our  already  encouraging  steps  to  make  Vermont resistant  to  national  recessionary  cycles,  requires  that  we  continue  our  many-sided  efforts  to  enlarge  present industry and bring in new investments. Education and training do, of course, have a major part in this, but so do more  direct  development  tools  —  siting  assistance,  attractive  credit,  local  cooperation,  and  others.  The  funds available to the Vermont Industrial Development Authority are important to this effort. I hope  that  this year you will authorize expanded efforts  to strengthen agriculture  in Vermont —  this  is at a time when changes in federal price supports pose a problem for many farmers. These initiatives will be grouped into  an  agricultural  enhancement  program,  to  enable  our  State  Department  of  Agriculture  to  give  additional assistance  to  farmers  and  agricultural  industries.  This  modest  investment  will  pay  for  itself  many  times  over through  promotion  of  Vermont  products,  development  of  new  markets,  increase  of  milk  consumption,  and improvement of milk quality. As a further step in preparing for the future I urge  the enactment of constitutional amendments dealing with the structure of  the executive branch. Recognizing  that  thoughtful planning and skilled, orderly  implementation were  a  prerequisite  to  stability,  Vermonters  in  1870  amended  the  constitution  to  extend  the  term  of  governor and  other  offices  from  one  to  two  years.  The  structure  and  complexity  of  our  society  and  the  value  of experienced  administrative  leadership  furnished  by  a  governor  have  increased  fully  as  much  in  the  hundred years since  the  two year  term was enacted as  in  the hundred years prior. The wisdom which guided  that change today calls upon us to lengthen the term of office to four years. Nearly every other state has come to believe the public’s  interest  is  best  served  by  a  longer  period  of  governance  and  reduced  intervals  of  campaigning  or transitioning. I believe, too, that Vermont should amend its constitution to elect the governor and lieutenant governor from the  same  party  as  a  team.  Clearly,  a  cooperative  and  supportive  relationship  between  Vermont’s  two  highest elected officials would be beneficial to all. Surely  there  is much  for  us  to  consider. The  responsibilities  are greater  in  these  times of national  transition and major change in economic circumstance than would be the case in more settled times. But Vermonters have a history of meeting challenges squarely. We must once again demonstrate our foresight and our courage. For  in  these  directions,  lie,  in  some  instances,  the  beginnings,  while  in  others  .  .  .  the  aspirations,  the  self-determination  and  the  resolve  of  Vermonters  to  carry  with  us  the  independence  of  our  past  as  we  prepare  to build new strength and enduring independence for our future.
