Inaugural address of  Redfield Proctor    As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1923    Thursday, January 4, 1923 Inaugural Message   Members of General Assembly:  Custom  prescribes  that  at  the  opening  of  the  session  the  Governor  shall  present  to  the  Joint  Assembly recommendations  with  respect  to  legislation.  It  is  hardly  possible  that  a  governor  at  the  beginning  of  his  term would be able to make as valuable recommendations as later. I shall not attempt, therefore, at this time to cover all  that might  be  suitable  to  bring  to  your  attention,  hoping  that  during  the  session  there may  be  opportunity  to present to you other matters which seem to require our mutual consideration.  In  our  scheme  of  government  much  depends  upon  the  loyal  support  and  conscious  participation  of  every citizen. A government  so  essentially by  and of  the people  cannot be  any better  than  the  people make  it  and  the more keenly  each  individual  citizen  appreciates his  responsibilities  as well  as prizes his  liberties,  the better our government  will  be.  There  has  been  a  very  strong  tendency  in  recent  years  for  the  federal  government  to  take over duties  that naturally belong  to  the  state, and  in  turn  for  the  states  to  take over duties naturally  resting with the  towns  and  other  local  municipalities.  I  believe  our  return  to  a  condition  in  which  the  towns  feel  the maximum  responsibility  for  the  general  welfare  and  the  maintenance  of  good  government  is  very  essential, always with  sufficient  ultimate  control  resting  in  the  state  to  insure  fairness  between  the  towns  and  uniformity of benefit to all our citizens.  Contempt  for  one  law  tends  to  breed  disregard  for  all  laws,  a  spirit which  in  these  times  seems  regrettably and  dangerously  prevalent. Laws  are  laws  and  no  one  has  a  right  to  strike  at  such  an  essential  and  vital  part  of the life of our country as to disregard and break them. Our government is directly controlled by those whom it is designed  to govern  and without  the  loyal  support  of  the  people  cannot  continue  to  exist. President Harding has emphatically pointed this out in his recent message to Congress. “There is a demand,” said he, “for every living being  in  the United States  to  respect  and  abide by  the  laws of  the  republic. Let men who  are  rending  the moral fibre of  the  republic  through  easy  contempt of  the prohibition  law, because  they  think  it  restricts  their personal liberty,  remember  that  they  set  the  example  and  breed  a  contempt  for  law  which  will  ultimately  destroy  the republic.”  It is fundamentally necessary that the laws be faithfully executed. I have taken a solemn oath to see that they are  so  executed  and,  so  far  as  power  lies  in  me,  I  propose  to  do  this  with  absolute  fairness  and  without  any offensive discrimination.  EXECUTIVE BUDGET  I  recommend  the adoption of  the executive budget system of appropriation  instead of  the budget system we now  have.  This method,  which  has  been  adopted  by  a  large  number  of  states  and  by  the  national  government, has proved itself worthy of our most favorable consideration. By it all estimates and requests for appropriations for  the  activities  of  the  state  would  be  carefully  prepared  by  the  Governor,  who  is  responsible  for  their administration,  and  presented  to  the Legislature  at  an  early  date  in  the  session. The Legislature  by  this method would have before it a comprehensive statement of what, in the opinion of those charged with the carrying on of the  state’s  business,  will  be  required  for  the  purpose.  While  still  in  absolute  control  of  all  appropriations,  the Legislature  would  be  in  a  position  to  judge  more  easily  and  more  wisely  for  what  work  and  in  what  amounts funds  should  be  provided.  The  budget  should  be  made  up  with  direct  reference  to  the  expected  income  and should  not  be  allowed  to  exceed  that  amount  except  in  time  of  great  emergency.  We  have  been  loading  our wagon  before  we  knew  the  team  that  was  to  draw  it.  A  budget  based  on  expected  income  offers  the  only practical method of  setting  a definite  limit  to  the  state’s  expenditure.  I  shall not  feel  justified  in  recommending or approving appropriations in excess of expected income.  CONSOLIDATION OF DEPARTMENTS  During  recent  years  the  state  has  taken  on many  new  activities,  thereby  greatly  increasing  the  total  amount of  work  done  by  persons  in  the  employ  of  the  state  and  the  total  cost  for  which  the  taxpayers  of  the  state  are called  upon  to  supply  the  necessary  funds.  Much  of  this  has  been  added  in  separate  and  small  units  and  to  a considerable extent without particular regard to other work, at least as respecting the simplest, most economical and most efficient way of accomplishing  the whole. There  seems  to be a very general  feeling  that  the  total cost of government  is more  than  it should be, and  that we pay a  larger sum  in  taxes  than necessary. It seems proper, and  the  platforms  of  the  principal  parties  in  the  recent  campaign  urged  that  this  Legislature  should  take seriously  in  hand  the  task  of  simplifying  the  machinery  of  our  government.  What  Governor  Lowden  said  of Illinois  is  quite  as  true  of  Vermont:  “One  of  the  imperative  needs  of  the  state  is  the  consolidation  of  its multiplied  agencies  into  a  few  principal  departments.  The  Governor  is  held  responsible  for  the  conduct  of  the state  government.  His  executive  functions  should  be  discharged  through  a  limited  number  of  agencies  over which  he  may  exercise  actual  control.  Under  the  present  system  of  confusing  perplexity,  the  Governor  cannot exercise the supervision and control which the people have a right to demand.”  Without  in  any way  affecting  the  duties  of  officers or  departments  as  provided  by  the Constitution, we  can very much  simplify our governmental organization by  combining  some departments and placing  the duties and activities  of  some  officers  and  boards  upon  others,  and  still  accomplish  fully  as  much  for  the  benefit  of  our citizens more efficiently and at  less expense. To accomplish  this undoubtedly means  that some  things will have to  be  done  in  ways  not  quite  as  satisfactory  to  those  interested  in  some  particular  activity,  but  you  are  here representing the people from all parts of the state and should take such action as you believe best for the people as a whole. Likewise it is my duty to make recommendations for the benefit of the whole state. Neither you nor I should give undue weight to that locality or that department with which we have come most closely in contact, or  in  which  we  personally  are  most  interested.  It  is  quite  impossible  to  economize  by  simply  talking  about  it. Economy  is  not  talk  but  practice  and  in  practice  it  is  always  difficult  to  cut  down  expenses  once  begun.  We have  become  so  accustomed  to  large  expenditures  during  the  war  and  since  that  economy  is  nearly  a  lost  art, and  yet  real  sane  economy  throughout  the  world  would  perhaps  do  more  than  anything  else  to  restore  it  to  a normal basis.  DIRECTOR OF FINANCE  I recommend the creation of the office of Director of Finance, the Director to be appointed by the Governor with  the advice and consent of  the Senate and  that  there be combined under  the general charge of  this officer a large  amount  of  financial  and  semi-financial  work  now  undertaken  by  various  state  officials.  Under  his  hand within  his  office  should  be  included  the  work  of  the  Tax  Commissioner,  the  Banking  Commissioner,  the Insurance Commissioner  and  perhaps  others. He  should  further  be  charged with  the  preliminary  preparation  of the  budget:  that  is,  the  assembling  of  the  necessary  data  on  which  may  be  based  the  recommendations  of  the Governor to the Legislature with respect to all appropriations.  STATE INSTITUTIONS  With  the five state  institutions already  in charge of  the Director of State  Institutions, should be  included  the Vermont Sanatorium,  such  duties  as  the  state  has  in  connection with  the Washington County Hospital,  and  the work of the Board of Charities and Probation, and three boards be dispensed with.  The  act  creating  the Board  of Charities  and Probation was  justifiable  and  the Board  has  done  a worthwhile work but much for which it was created has already been accomplished. A great part of its duties are so closely connected  with  our  institutions  and  the  work  which  they  do  that  this  consolidation  can  be  made  at  a  very substantial  saving  in  effort  and  expense.  Some  of  the  charitable  work  of  the  Board  can  readily  and  more properly  be  done,  and  a  large  amount  of  similar  work  is  now  being  done,  by  private  organizations,  more efficiently and economically and at a considerable saving to the state.  Joined  to  and  included  with  this  department  should  be  the  State  Board  of  Supervisors  of  the  Insane,  but without changing their duties, authority or method of appointment.  Because of  the  increase and  the nature of  this added work  it may seem best  to provide a deputy  to assist  the Director.  This  department  should  be  in  effect  our  Department  of  Public  Welfare,  and  it  is  so  called  in  many states.  AGRICULTURE  The  extension  of  the  work  of  eradicating  bovine  tuberculosis  has  aroused  considerable  controversy throughout  the  state  and  the  necessity  of  condemning  cattle  has  sometimes  worked  a  serious  hardship  to farmers.  There  are  sharp  differences  of  opinion—even  among  experts—as  to  the  proper  policy  to  pursue. Disregarding all  theory,  it  is necessary on practical commercial grounds,  in view of  the  importance of our dairy industry,  to  establish  and  guarantee  a  high  standard  for  all  the  cattle  of  the  state.  A  committee  appointed  by Governor  Hartness  has  been  investigating  this  question  and  its  findings  and  recommendations  should  be carefully considered before forming any definite conclusions. Our future policy should have the ultimate aim of preventing  the  disease  from  developing,  rather  than  merely  condemning  infected  cattle  after  it  has  developed. The  appropriation  for  this  work  has  increased  rapidly  within  recent  years.  It  should  not  increase  further  and ought  to be  reduced. Restrictive  legislation effective on a definite  future date  is needed  to prevent  the necessity for continuing large appropriations indefinitely.  To  the  present  duties  of  the  Commissioner  of  Agriculture  I  recommend  adding  those  of  the  State  Fair Commission  and  the  Creamery  Commissioners.  With  its  appropriation  should  properly  be  included  the appropriations for country fairs, for horticulture, dairymen’s associations, maple sugar, etc.  EDUCATION  Extensive  changes  do  not  seem  necessary  in  our  present  educational  laws.  I  believe  that  the  Board  of Education can further reduce the number of supervisors and at the same time improve the quality of supervision. To  the  present  duties  of  the  Board  of  Education  may  well  be  added  the  duties  and  authority  of  the  Board  of Public  Library  Commissioners.  This  work  is  largely  educational  in  character  and  can  properly  be  done  by  the Board of Education.  The appropriation for education has become one of the largest items of state expense. The increase in recent years has been due in part to higher wages paid to teachers, and also to the demand of our citizens for more and better  educational  facilities  for  their  children. Our  schools  have  reached  a  standard  that  does  credit  to  the  state and  this  high  standard  must  be  maintained.  We  should  try  to  economize  by  cutting  down  overhead  wherever possible  in  the  department,  but  not  by  making  a  reduction  at  the  expense  of  the  common  schools.  Avoiding experiments in educational novelties, we must stick to fundamentals and in these be thorough.  The  centralization  of  school  districts  has  generally  proved  effective  but  should  not  be  carried  so  far  as  to weaken  the  rural  communities.  The  country  school  must  remain  and  be  improved.  It  is  not  a  mere  classroom, but  a  community  house,  the  center  of  local  interest  and  improving  influences,  and  a  meeting  place  for neighborhood activities. It ought to constitute an  important moral  influence  in  the  life of rural communities and this we should encourage and strengthen.  Within our state are three excellent institutions for higher education, all doing creditable work, and we have reason  to  be  proud  of  them.  Toward  the  support  of  these  the  state  makes  very  substantial  contributions. With each succeeding year the alumni of these institutions increase in number and in ability to help their Alma Mater; and these institutions ought to become increasingly able to support themselves. In educational work it is the first duty  of  the  state  to  provide  amply  for  elementary  education—the  common  schools—and  the  state  should  not increase  in  any  way  its  appropriations  for  the  three  colleges  already  authorized  by  general  statutes  and  as provided for by the last legislature in the regular appropriation for the support of government.   PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION  The Public Service Commission  in  its  report  recommends  that  it be given certain authority  in  respect  to  the removal  of  obstructions  near  grade  crossings  when  the  view  of  the  track  is  restricted,  the  expense  to  be apportioned  as  in  the  elimination  of  such  crossings.  In  many  instances  a  crossing  can  in  this  way  be  made comparatively safe and the adoption of this plan seems justifiable and wise.   The Public Service Commission and the Commissioner of Industries are the state officials coming in contact with  our  industrial  and  public  service  companies  and  their  duties  may  properly  be  grouped  into  one  major department, making in effect a department of Public Service and Industries.  HIGHWAYS  The  last  Legislature  made  a  very  radical  change  in  the  organization  of  the  Highway  Department.  The Highway Board, of which the Governor is chairman, now determines road policies, while road expenditures are directed  by  a  Commissioner  of  Highways,  appointed  by  the  Board  and  removable  at  its  pleasure.  Thus  the determination  of  road  policy  is  left  to  the  combined  judgment  of  three  men  and  the  immediate  execution  of highway work to one. This plan has been in operation less than two years. Certain conditions connected with its inception  and  workings  have  prevented  a  fair  test  of  its  utility—and  it  is  too  soon  to  attempt  to  appraise  the value of  the new plan by  its  results. However one may  feel as  to  the  real wisdom of  that change,  it  is a mistake to keep changing. The commission plan should be given further trial before we attempt any more experiments.   The  work  of  the  State  Engineer’s  office  is  so  very  largely  for  the  Highway  Department  that  this  office should be included within and be a part of the Highway Department.  The  policy  of  road  construction  best  suited  to  our  needs  is  not  yet  a  fixed  fact  but  is  still  in  the  realm  of opinion.  For  us  the  question  is  not  whether  cement  roads  are  better  than  others,  but  whether  or  not  they  are within  our  reach. With  our  extensive  road  mileage,  limited  income  and  dispersed  population,  the  costly  roads which  some  states have  are out of  the question.  In  certain places,  even outside of villages,  it  is quite  justifiable to construct stretches of concrete roads, but it is a wrong principal to sacrifice everything to surface. Our policy must be to hold fast to the essential principles of road building of grades and curves, deep foundation and proper drainage. New methods of treating road surfaces are being developed, and the whole science of road building is progressing faster  than ever before. It would be a serious mistake  to commit ourselves  in advance  to a hard and fast programme, or to engage in expensive experiments. Methods which have proved successful in other regions are not necessarily adapted to our own conditions. The deep frosts of our winters will destroy rapidly roads that stand  up  well  in  warmer  and  drier  climates.  Local  conditions  in  different  parts  of  the  state  must  also  be  taken into  account,  and  our  aim  should  be  not  to  apply  a  uniform  system  to  all  places, but  to build  roads  to  stand  the traffic they have to bear.  The  dust  nuisance  is  a  very  serious  one.  I  advise  that  necessary  funds  be  provided  to  do  away with  this  by calcium chloride, oil or otherwise. This work should be under  the patrol division and  the patrol work should be extended  to  include  more  of  the  roads  of  considered  trunk  lines.  The  life  and  service  of  gravel  roads  depends very greatly on this constant care.  AUTOMOBILE REGISTRATION AND GASOLINE TAX  There  is  rather  general  dissatisfaction  with  our  present  basis  of  automobile  registration  fees.  The  auto  tax laws should be thoroughly revised and favorable consideration may well be given to the Connecticut law, which is  based  on  piston  displacement,  and  therefore  seems  to  much  more  closely  represent  the  power  of  the  car  in relation to its probable wear and tear on the roads. Weight is perhaps a fairer basis for taxation than our present method and a scheme based substantially on weight is worthy of your consideration. The lighter, lower powered cars  can  fairly  be  asked  to  pay  as  much  as  they  do  now  and  the  heavier,  higher  powered  and  more  expensive cars  a  fairly  proportioned  increased  rate.  Since  the  proceeds  from  this  tax  are  intended  for  the maintenance  of the highways, and a car more than a year old subjects the road to quite as much wear as a new car, the decrease in  the  tax  for  the  second,  third  and  subsequent  years  should  be  either  entirely  done  away  with  or  very  much lessened.  In  this connection I would also suggest for your consideration a one-cent gasoline  tax  to be collected on  the wholesale  basis.  This  may  seem  to  some  to  work  a  hardship  on  persons  using  gasoline  for  stationary  engines, but  if  the  tax  were  established  on  a  retail  basis,  experience  elsewhere  indicates  that  it  is  very  difficult  and expensive to collect and that it creates a great deal of dissatisfaction. The amount used for stationary engines is, I  am  told,  a  very  small  fraction  of  the  total.  The  theory  of  this  tax  on  gasoline  is  that  those who  use  the  roads most  should  contribute  most  to  their  maintenance.  It  would  help  to  equalize  the  burden  of  road  up-keep  and would provide sufficient revenue to assist in abating the dust nuisance. It is estimated that about $200,000 could be  raised  in  this  way.  An  indirect  tax  upon  automobiles,  which  seems  to  be  required  by  the  necessities  of  the highways, is not so much of tax as a highway toll.  BOARD OF CONTROL  I  recommend  the  discontinuance  of  the  Board  of  Control,  believing  that  after  a  fair  trial  it  has  not  proved itself  a  sufficiently  valuable  addition  in  our  scheme  of  government  to  warrant  its  retention.  In  the  minds  of many  it  is  calculated  to  limit  the  authority  and  responsibility  of  the  Governor  and  to  prevent  his  being  wholly responsible  for  the  work  of  the  Executive  Department  as  constitutionally  provided.  To  a  certain  extent  it  has acted  as  an  interim  Legislature.  Such  a  body  was  not  contemplated  by  our  Constitution  and  has  tended substantially  to  decrease  the  effectiveness  of  certain  of  its  provisions.  Without  giving  greater  authority  to  the Governor  in  any  way  than  was  contemplated  and  provided  by  the  constitution,  the  duties  now  assigned  by statute to the Board of Control can properly and more efficiently be provided for in other ways.  The  machinery  of  our  government  can  work  efficiently  only  if  allowed  to  operate  in  the  way  it  was designed.  The  Legislature  must  remain  primarily  responsible  for  making  laws  arid  appropriations.  The Executive,  with  the  Governor  at  its  head,  must  execute  the  laws  and  carry  on  the  administration  and  general business of  the  state. The  two must co-operate, but  remain  independent and each be held  to  its own  task. There has  been  a  tendency  throughout  the  country  to  handle  difficult  problems  by  creating  boards  or  commissions exercising  independent  authority.  They  are  not  directly  responsible  to  the  voters  or  under  the  control  of  either the  Legislature  or  the  Governor  and  tend  to  confuse  and  obstruct  the  frame  of  government  originally established, which was simple, clear and sound. The nearer we keep to that, the better.  FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  The State Treasurer  in  addition  to being  the  custodian of  the  funds of  the  state and  the officer charged with the  duty  of  actually  drawing  checks,  should  keep  the  state’s  books,  showing  all  revenues  and  expenditures.  In many  states  this  has  been  placed  in  the  hands  of  the  Director  of  Finance,  but  in  our  state  this  very  important work may well be in the hands of a constitutional officer elected by the people.  The  Auditor  of  Accounts  should  audit  income  of  revenue  as  completely  as  he  does  outgo  or  expense  and should  be  left  free  to  do  this  work  without  other  interfering  duties.  Our  system  of  accounting  for  revenue  and expense should be so arranged as  to permit  the state  to keep a  set of books which will  really  show  revenue and expense  and  the  keeping  of  these  books  by  one  official  should  be  sufficient.  There  is  now  considerable duplication of this work.  PLEDGED REVENUE  The  custom  exists  to  some  extent  in  our  administration  of  pledging  by  statute  the  entire  revenue  of  certain departments  or  activities  of  the  particular  work  from  which  the  revenue  comes  or  to  some  other  specified purpose.  This  is  what  in  our  accounting  system  is  called  “pledged  revenue.”  The  appropriation  acts  make  no mention  of  large  sums  of money  received  and  paid  out  in  this way. While  in  such  cases  the  department  cannot expend  in excess of what  is collected, on  the other hand  it can expend all of  the  revenues  so collected however large  the  amount may  be. All  revenue  including  fees  should  be  paid  into  the  treasury,  there  accounted  for,  and be  paid  out  only  upon  specific  legislative  appropriation. While  it may  be  desirable  to  limit  an  appropriation  to the  amount  of  fees  collected,  it  is  equally  desirable  that  the  maximum  expenditure  permitted  in  any  event  be limited to a definite fixed sum. This does not necessitate any improper curtailment of the available funds for any department.  The  amount  of  revenue  can  be  closely  estimated  and  these  specific  appropriations  changed  as seems wise by each succeeding Legislature.  Also  we  should  discontinue  the  custom  of  providing  by  statute  for  continuing  appropriations.  Each Legislature  should  consider  each  and  every  demand  upon  the  state  and  provide  the  funds  to  be  used  for  every purpose at each  regular biennial session.  In  this way also our system of accounting would be made simpler and more readily understood. At present, it is not easy for a new legislator to know the real condition of the finances of the state, owing to the system which holds large sums in the treasury pledged for specific purposes.  LIMITATION OF SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The  appropriation  acts  for  the  various  departments  should  fix  the  amount  that  can  be  expended  for  each  of the  larger  sub-divisions  of  their  work—as,  for  example,  clerical  assistance,  office  and  similar  supplies, transportation and other expenses allowed to officials and employees.   As  a  result  of  legislation  enacted  in  1917,  nearly  all  of  the  principal  state  offices  are  now  maintained  at Montpelier.  No  full  time  state  official  having  his  office  there  should  be  allowed  his  unlimited  living  expenses there  and  travel  expenses  between  his  home  and  Montpelier.  The  sum  allowed  for  these  expenses  should  be specified  and  any  allowance  is  justifiable  only  insofar  as  to  make  the  remuneration  fairly  equal,  regardless  of where in the state the officer’s home may be.  TAXATION  Whatever the state raises directly or indirectly comes eventually out of the people. The taxes paid by savings banks  and  trust  companies  on  their  deposits  affect  the  rate  of  interest  paid  depositors.  The  taxes  paid  by railroads  and  public  utilities  effect  either  the  rates  people  have  to  pay  or  their  service  or  the  quality  of  the service  rendered.  Taxes  are  taxes,  whether  raised  directly  or  indirectly  and  whether  paid  to  the  town,  state  or national government. Their sum total, howsoever raised, makes the tax burden and that burden most people feel, and rightly, is already too large.  Generally  direct  taxes  are  better  than  indirect  taxes  in  that  the  people  are  more  immediately  conscious  of them and  there  is more motive  to use  the money  thus provided wisely and  frugally. But as our  towns and cities are restricted to direct taxation and their average rate of direct taxes is already so high as to be disturbing, I hope the addition of a special direct state tax can be avoided.  There has been considerable complaint that the basis of appraisal for taxes is not equal in the different towns and that something in the nature of a state board of equalization is needed. The importance of that arises chiefly when the state imposes a special direct tax. If that is avoided and direct state taxes are limited to the state school tax  of  ten  cents,  and  the  state  highway  tax  of  five  cents,  the  relative  basis  of  appraisal  in  different  towns becomes distinctly less important.  A  small  state  income  tax  is  utilized  by  some  states.  When  the  income  tax  amendment  to  the  federal Constitution  was  adopted  the  states  in  effect  largely  surrendered  any  opportunity  to  utilize  that  system  of taxation  for  themselves. The national government has  thoroughly pre-occupied  this  field with  rates so high  that the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  in  his  late  annual  report  to  Congress  says  that  they  put  constant  pressure  on taxpayers  to  reduce  their  taxable  income,  interfere with  the  transaction  of  business  and  the  free  flow  of  capital into  productive  enterprise,  and  are  rapidly  becoming  unproductive. An  income  tax  to  apply  generally  and with reasonable  uniformity  is  a  fair  method  of  taxation.  I  do  not  think,  however,  that  it  ought  to  be  considered  in addition to present methods of taxation but, if at all, in lieu of some of them.  Our whole tax system for state and towns originally established and developed under very different and less exacting  conditions  is  far  from  satisfactory.    How  much  it  can  be  improved  without  some  very  fundamental changes  is  problematical. While  the  bulk  of  taxes  ought  not  to  be  increased,  it  does  not  follow  that  reasonable changes  in  our  methods  of  taxation  or  their  details  calculated  to  simplify  the  same  and  to  remove  inequalities should not be considered, but at this time I have no particular recommendations to make with respect thereto.  The problem of economy  is not how  to get more  income out of  somebody, but how  to use what we have  in the wisest  and most  frugal way.  In  the  larger  concerns  of  government,  as  in  personal  affairs, we  need  to  return to  that  frugality  and  husbanding  of  resources  which  used  to  be  particularly  characteristic  of  the  people  of  our state. Our problem ought to be how to take the least from the people and to give them the most in return. __________________  In  conclusion  let  me  remind  you  that  you  are  assembled  to  enact  laws  for  the  best  good  of  all  our  people, while  upon  me  devolves  primarily  the  duty  of  seeing  to  it  that  those  laws  be  faithfully  executed.  Let  us, therefore,  together  in harmony and  for  the best  interests of our well-loved  state proceed  to our  respective  tasks, using  care  not  to  let  anything  divert  us  from  the  serious  and  important  business  of  the  legislative  session. We will  do  well  to  heed  the  admonition  of  our  Constitution.  “That  frequent  recurrence  to  fundamental  principles, and  a  firm  adherence  to  justice,  moderation,  temperance,  industry  and  frugality,  are  absolutely  necessary  to preserve the blessings of liberty, and keep our government free.”    REDFIELD PROCTOR
