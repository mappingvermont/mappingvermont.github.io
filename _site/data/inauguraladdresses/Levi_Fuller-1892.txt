Inaugural address of  Levi K. Fuller  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1892  Thursday, October 6, 1892 Inaugural Address  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:  Having  been  elected  Chief  Magistrate  of  the  State,  I  assume  the  office  with  a  sense  of  the  great responsibility  resting  upon  me,  realizing  my  need  of  the  kindly  forbearance  of  all.    The  Constitution  imposes upon  the  executive  the  duty  of  laying  before  you  such  information  and  rendering  such  aid  as  may  be  in  his power  in  determining  the  various  questions  that  arise  in  the  interests  of  the  State,  to  the  end  that  suitable provision may  be made  for  the wants  of  the  government,  in  the  enactment  of  proper  laws  for  the  guidance  and welfare of the people.  I trust I may enjoy your confidence and kind consideration. Invoking  the  aid  of  Him  who  giveth  wisdom  necessary  alike  to  all,  and  without  which  we  may  hope  to accomplish  but  little,  under  his  guiding  hand  we  may  approach  the  duties  incumbent  upon  us  with  reasonable assurance. In  due  time,  reports  of  the  various  State  officers  will  be  laid  before  you,  which  will  exhibit  in  detail  the operations of the different departments of the State government for the biennial term. Several of these have come into my hands too late for that study which it is desirable should be made by one whose duty it is to write concerning them. The  law  which  permits  State  reports  to  be  printed  at  so  late  a  day,  in  some  instances  not  until  after  the legislature  meets,  affords  no  proper  opportunity  for  the  executive  or  people  to  examine  the  reports  or  to intelligently arrange for future legislation. All of these reports should be in the hands of the printer, not later then the 20th of August, and I recommend that the law be changed accordingly. STATE TREASURER. An examination of  the  report of  the State Treasurer  shows  the  receipts and disbursements  for  the  two years ending June 30, 1892, to be as follows:   Receipts.

The  legislature  of  1890  made  a  careful  revision  of  the  law  taxing  corporations,  the  results  of  which  are clearly set forth  in  the report of  the Commissioner of State Taxes.   By  it will be seen  that only one corporation, the  Western  Union  Telegraph  Company,  seriously  objects  to  the  provisions  of  the  law  and  has  commenced  a suit  in chancery enjoining  the commissioner  from enforcing  the  tax or penalties, which suit  is set  for hearing  in December. I do not believe  it wise  in  the midst of  litigation  to attempt  to disturb or revise the  law, but you may correct with safety the double deduction of the value of real estate shown to exist in connection with trust companies. The amount of taxes assessed for the biennial term is shown by the report to be as follows: Total taxes assessed against corporations  ................................................................................$572,672  96 Total license taxes assessed  ...........................................................................................................8,537  00 STATE AUDITOR. Your attention  is  invited  to  the  report of  the State Auditor concerning  the expenses of government. Retiring after  a  faithful  service  of  fourteen  years,  his  suggestions,  the  result  of  ripe  experience  and  a  keen  sense  of  the needs  of  the  State,  cannot  be  lightly  passed  over.  It  is  your  especial  privilege,  as  it  is  your  duty,  to  investigate the particular matters to which he refers with a view of reducing the expenses of government. The  tax paid by  the people of Vermont for  the support of  local and state government  is felt by many  to be a hardship  from  which  time  should  bring  reasonable  relief.  The  inventory  law  passed  in  1880  was  a  step  in advance  to  secure  better  returns  of  property with  greater  equality,  and  an  increase  in  property  values;  it  shifted the  burden  of  taxation  from  the  poor  to  the  rich  in  a  sensible  degree;  but  this  relief  was  soon  dissipated  by increased calls, both local and general, upon the public revenue. The  enactment  of  the  corporation  tax  law  in  1882,  was  a  measure  well  calculated  to  raise  the  hope  that  a direct  State  tax  would  not  much  longer  be  needed,  but  the  increasing  demands  of  the  times  have  gone  far beyond  its  ability  to  supply  the  money  necessary  for  State  expenses,  although  it  has  been  revised  until  its revenues to the State have nearly doubled. There  are  different  ways  by  which  a  change  can  be  effected.  We  can  search  for  new  sources  of  revenue, turning the old screws down a little  tighter, although  this will require special skill, knowledge and patience, but sometimes  a  well  worn  thread  snaps  asunder.  Or  we  can  take  the  short  road,  which  all  can  travel,  and  which consists in spending less money. This latter method may not be popular with some, but it will be easier for all. I do  not  advocate  neglect  of  any  public  interest  or  a  course  of  false  economy;  indeed  parsimony  is  sometimes  a calamity, in causing at a later period what then appear to be extravagant expenditures. The House of Correction is of modern type, the Prison has been rebuilt, the Reform School is well equipped, the  Soldier’s  Home  secured,  the  new  asylum  completed  to  admit  one-third  its  proposed  capacity,  and  fully occupied,  and  all  of  these  will  require  constant  repair  and  possibly  future  enlargement,  but  their  maintenance only  is  imperative  applying  the  thoughts  and  suggestions  that  naturally  arise  in  this  connection.    I  believe  it possible to secure such a reduction of expenses as to satisfy all reasonable expectations. An even temperature in monetary affairs is conducive to financial health. INSPECTOR OF FINANCE. From the report of the inspector of finance, it appears that our savings banks are in a healthy condition. For the two years ending June 30, 1892, there has been an increase in deposits of ........  $5,344,176.84 Total deposits June 30, 1892 .................................................................................................. $24,674,741.76 14,981 Increase in number of depositors  .............................................................................. 72,635 Number depositors resident in the State .................................................................... Total number depositors ............................................................................................ 80,740 The  great  care  and  prudence  with  which  these  institutions  are managed  gives  increasing  confidence  to  our people, inducing them to retain their savings at home rather than to adapt the more hazardous course of sending them to distant points with all the attendant risks. I especially call your attention to that part of the report which refers  to  the  omission  in  the  law  requiring  returns  to  be  made  under  oath,  also  to  the  necessity  of  trust companies carrying a portion of their profits to surplus. Several of the savings banks have so large a surplus that they may deem  it prudent  to declare extra dividends;  the present  law  for computing  the  same  is  so complicated that  it  becomes  imperative  that  depositors  be  divided  into  classes  covering  different  periods  of  time. With  the vicissitudes incident to losses in business, by depreciation of securities or otherwise, it would seem that in cases of this kind a more prudent measure would be to increase the surplus, from ten per cent of the deposits to fifteen per cent of the same. The time should be changed when the inspector is required to make the report. To this end the date ought to be fixed from which the fine begins to run against savings banks for failure to make reports to the inspector. The  various  financial  institutions  that  now  make  reports  to  the  inspector,  and  receive  from  him  an acknowledgement  or  copy  of  a  statement,  use  that  document  precisely  as  if  it  were  a  legal  license  to  transact business  with  the  endorsement  of  the  state  government  to  solicit  funds  from  our  people,  for  investment  or speculation abroad. I  recommend  that  a  change  be  made  in  this  matter  in  such  a  way  that  the  pocket  document  will  be eliminated, and this means of temptation to our people avoided. The State does not endorse or recommend these institutions,  it  simply  says  to  them  that  if  they  do  business  here,  they  must  file  a  statement  showing  their standing.  Beyond this the state should not be made to appear to be a party to any of their transactions. EDUCATION. The  recent  legislation  affecting  the  schools  of  the  State  has  borne  fruit  in  the  greater  interest  shown  in educational matters,  and  in  some  respects  a more  satisfactory  state  of  affairs  now  exists. While  it  is  unwise  to change  our  system  too  frequently,  I  think  you  have  a  further  duty  in  devising  ways  and  means  to  elevate  the standing  of  the  schools  of  the  State.    I  believe  that  the  school  district  having  supervision  under  a  single  head, should  be  made  as  large  as  possible.  In  many  places  the  town  system  will  give  the  best  educational  results, provided proper school machinery, with which to work, is furnished; but in some of the smaller districts situated in the more sparsely settled communities this undoubtedly will work considerable hardship. In many  instances  the  furnishing of books and  supplies bears heavily upon  the parent. A working man with a large family, having to pay from $3.00 to $5.00 per annum for books for each child, will be induced to remove the child  from  the  school at an earlier age  than he would  if  the books were  furnished by  the  town or district.  In places  where  it  has  been  tried,  this  expense  has  been  reduced  so  low  for  each  scholar  per  annum,  that  this feature  alone  should  commend  it. A  careful  estimate  of  the  saving  to  the  people  of  the  State,  based  upon what has  been  done,  convinces  me  that  more  than  $300,000  per  year  can  be  saved  to  the  people  who  now  have  to bear  this  expense.  The  objection,  if  any,  that will  be  raised  against  it,  is  likely  to  come  from  property  interests and  the  manufacturer  and  dealer  in  school  books;  but  is  not  the  duty  of  the  State  to  the  children  greater  than their obligations to these? The  reports  of  the  various County Examiners,  together with  the  recommendations  of  the  Superintendent  of Education, point out ways in which further inquiry can be made. If it is possible for you to devise any additional means of improvement in any direction it will be welcomed by all. UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT AND STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. This  venerable  institution,  originally  chartered  in  1791,  has  been  the  recipient  of  the  fostering  care  of  both the State  and national governments. At  the present  time  there are practically  four  allied  schools;  the Academic, Medical, Mechanical and Agricultural, the practical operations of which are clearly set forth in the report of the trustees.   More  than  usual  interest  attaches  to  this  institution  at  the  present  time,  from  the  fact  that  a  thorough investigation  into  the workings of  the various departments was made at  the  last session of  the  legislature, when it was sought to separate the Mechanical and Agricultural departments from the University. I  have made  several  visits  to  the  institution  to  acquaint myself with  the  progress  that  has  been made  in  the improvement of facilities and methods for furnishing to the youth of the State all those opportunities which their ambition covets, near at home and at a cost within their reach. I  am  favorably  impressed with  the  present  appearance  of  the  institution,  as well  as  the  hopes,  expectations and ambitions of  the faculty.   An  institution of  this kind cannot be established without a  large outlay of money, years of growth and the confidence of the public. An examination of the course of study shows that there has been a tendency in the direction of the elevation of the standard instruction and the broadening of its scope to keep pace with the demands of the times, as fast as means at command would allow. The  Mechanical  department  has  received  additional  impetus  by  the  construction  of  new  buildings,  filled with standard machinery of the best models. The  announcement  is  made  that  benevolent  gentlemen  have  already  signified  their  intention  of  erecting other buildings, which will greatly convenience and promote the usefulness of the institution. A  new  farm  has  been  purchased  adjacent  to  the  University,  new  agricultural  buildings  have  been  erected thereon  and  the Agricultural Department  established  upon  a modern  basis  having  the  latest  facilities.    I  think  it can be  said  that  the  agitation  that has  taken place has been of great benefit  to  the  school,  in  that  its wants have been  sharply  called  to  the  attention  of  the  benevolent,  and  that  the  trustees,  alive  to  the  demands  upon  them, have  provided  liberally,  to  the  extent  of  boldness,  in making  provision  from  the  funds  of  the  institution  for  the wants of the school. I  am  satisfied  there  is  sufficient  enthusiasm with  the  faculty  to  cause  them  to meet  the new  conditions with an  earnest  purpose  to  give  the  student  the  very  best  they  can  devise,  and  believe  that  what  has  been accomplished warrants the continued fostering care of the State.  It certainly would be a public calamity for any harm to befall the institution.  BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. The  attempt  to  maintain  an  Agricultural  Bureau  in  Vermont  has  always  received  scant  support  from  those most interested and therefore small and inadequate appropriations have been made. I  think  it  good  business  policy  for  the  State  to  increase  the  opportunities,  responsibilities  and  duties  of  the Board  of  Agriculture.  There  can  be  committed  to  this  board  with  advantage  the  collecting  of  information  in connection with unoccupied or uncultivated land, putting in statistical form all information that can be gathered concerning the same, and promoting in this way any desirable change in ownership; they might be charged with inquiry concerning the forests, a matter too much neglected and about which a variety of opinions are held; they might  be  charged  with  the  furnishing  of  information  concerning  better  roads,  how  to  make  them  and  the  best kind  for  any  particular  locality.    They  could  assist  in  the  formation  of  farmer’s  clubs,  in  the  employ  and management of expert assistants for our dairy interests, and in the reestablishment and promotion of agricultural affairs in many new ways. Four years ago an attempt was made  to  induce Swedish  immigration upon  some of  the  abandoned  farms of this  state.    Such  inquiry  as  I  have  been  able  to make  concerning  this  experiment  reveals  the  fact  that  the  usual result  followed,  and  that  the young gradually  leave  and go  to business  centers,  leaving  the older people  to  care for the farm. This is not because of the class of people that come, or because they became dissatisfied with the land, but is incident  to  our  modern  civilization,  without  a  full  recognition  of  which,  we  cannot  hope  to  obtain  the  best results in any attempt to maintain the supremacy of our State. It  would  be  a  good  investment  to  furnish  the  bureau  of  agriculture  with  suitable  means  to  continue  this inquiry. One of the things that this State lacks at the present time, in industrial and agricultural affairs, is precise data and  information which can be secured with very slight expense  if attended  to yearly;  this can be gained and put in  suitable  book  form  for  preservation,  giving  us  ready  means  of  comparison  to  know  whether  one  policy  is better than another. I trust that no false modesty growing out of a fear that an actual statement of facts might uncover a condition of things unpleasant to see or know will deter you from doing your full duty in this matter. It  is  to  be  hoped  that  you will  see  your way  clear  to  enlarge  the  powers  of  the Board  of Agriculture  and  to increase that appropriation to an adequate amount. The  increasing  magnitude  of  the  dairy  interests  of  the  State  warrants  the  giving  of  more  attention  to  this industry.  In  this  connection  it  is  proper  to  note  the  work  of  the  Dairymen’s  Association  as  important  and growing, and it should receive that encouragement which it demands. PROHIBITORY LAW. Public  sentiment  sustains  the  rigid  enforcement  of  the  prohibitory  laws  of  the  State  to  a  commendable degree. We ought to see to it, therefore, that nothing is done to retard its healthy growth or bring ill repute upon our good intentions. Sentences  for  crime  ought  to  be  in  proportion  to  the  offence  committed. No  one will  pretend  that  violation of  the  prohibitory  law  deserves  a  life  sentence,  but  by  the  operations  of  the  mathematical  rule  of  cumulative sentences  under  the  present  provisions  of  the  law,  the  legal  period may  reach  far  beyond  the  natural  life  of  the prisoner,  in  which  case  the  severity  of  the  law  that  compels  such  a  cruel  sentence  would  be  held  up  as  an argument  against  its  proper  enforcement  and  would  appeal  so  strongly  to  the  sympathy  of  the  general  public that  repeated  instances  of  this  kind  might  set  in  motion  a  wave  of  unhealthy  agitation  that  would  sweep  away the work of years. Would  it  not  be well  in  imposing  sentence  for  non-payment  of  fines  in  liquor  cases,  that  a  period  be  fixed beyond which the sentence could not extend, say three or five years, no matter the amount of the fine imposed? If  it  could  be  shown  to  the  court  that  the  respondent  was  destitute  of  property  from  which  he  could  raise  the money to pay the fine, it might be well, in first offences, for the court to impose a sentence to the extreme limit of the law, and at the same time repose in the court power to collect a certain amount in money and then to take a bond for the remainder. This should be valid and enforced if the respondent is ever guilty of a second offence. Would not the giving of such a bond operate as a restraining influence upon  the offender to keep him out of the liquor  business?  As  it  is,  there  is  too  much  temptation  for  him  to  try  to  recoup  himself  by  increased  sales. Certainly  there  should be no  letting up of  the pursuit of  the  rumseller; every avenue  should be closely guarded, and the pressure gradually tightened until he abandons the business or flees the State. REFORM SCHOOL. The  report  of  the  trustees  of  the  Reform  School  shows  that  there  were  on  the  30th  day  of  June,  1892,  10 girls  and  54  boys  on  furlough  from  the  institution,  and  that  there  were  13  girls  and  71  boys  present  at  the institution. $32,168.65 Total expenses for the biennial term have been ..................................................................... 3,107.92 Total receipts from the operations of the school have been,.................................................. Leaving a net expense to the State of .................................................................................... 29,060.73 The  per  capita  expense  per  annum  for  supporting  the  inmates  of  the  school  has  averaged  $163.36.  For  the board,  clothing  and  schooling  of  children  where  so  high  a  standard  is  attempted  and  attained  this  price  is  not high, although I commend to you a careful study of the scope and purpose of the school. Some  of  the  children  there  give  little  hope  of  future  usefulness,  while  many  are  greatly  benefited  and  will become good citizens. With  ample  means  it  would  be  wise  to  attempt  a  more  thorough  classification  of  the  inmates  but  as  it  is  I think the best interests of the State will be subserved if the school is kept as small as possible. The re-enactment of the law charging towns fifty cents per week for each child committed will readily effect this. I cannot speak in too high terms of the excellent discipline that prevails and of the healthful influence of the officers and teachers, and the beneficial results attained at this institution. HOUSE OF CORRECTION. An examination of the report of the officers of the House of Correction, shows the number of prisoners  55 June 30th, 1890 ...................................................................................................................... Committed during the last two years  .................................................................................... 611 -------   Total .......................................................................................................................................  661 -------   578 Whole number discharged ..................................................................................................... 83 Remaining June 30, 1892 ....................................................................................................... $18,991.67 The expenses of the institution have been ................................................................. 5,855.93 Receipts have been  .................................................................................................... --------------   $13,136.74 Net expense to the State ......................................................................................................... It  appears  that  the  earnings  of  the  institution  for  the  past  two  years  amounting  to  46,788  days’  work,  have been applied  to  the purchase of  the working plant and supplies necessary  to keep  the prisoners employed,  to an amount  of  $13,383.08,  as  shown  by  the  inventory.  In  estimating  the  cost  of  maintaining  the  House  of Correction, it is proper that this sum should be treated as an appropriation for permanent improvements. The  discipline  of  the  institution  is  not  of  the  highest  order;  one  of  the  prisoners  has  been  sent  to  the  State Prison  for an aggravated assault upon one of  the officers, which adequate management of  the  institution should have avoided. I  call your  attention  to  the  remarks of  the Superintendent  concerning  short  term  imprisonment  for violation of the liquor law. The  trustees ask  for an appropriation of $6,000  to build a wall around  the  rear of  the  institution.   At present there  is  a  wooden  stockade,  as  good  now  as  in  the  past,  which  if  painted  would  continue  for  some  time  to  do service and not be unsightly. 45,946.98 34,848.52 --------------- $ 11,098.45 2,416.00 --------------- STATE PRISON.

Balance, expense to the state for operating the prison  for the biennial term ending June 30, 1892 .............................................................$  8,682.45 Our  penal  institutions  represent  certain  legal  and  moral  obligations  to  society.  We  cannot  escape  that obligation  nor  avoid  the  expense. Quite  likely  the  avenues  for  profitable  labor will  diminish with  time,  but  for the  present  the  trustees  are  able  to  furnish  employment  for  the  prisoners  that  brings  to  the  State  a  reasonable income. It is desirable to make them self-supporting were it possible, but we may not expect so favorable a turn in affairs. There  is  little  prospect,  it would  seem,  of  doing much  better,  and  therefore we must  turn  our  attention  to  a careful and economical management of the various institutions.  I have no sort of sympathy with the mercenary view which seeks to get long term prisoners to save expense. It  is  better  that  we  have  empty  walls  than  that  this  spirit  should  seize  hold  of  us;  the  good  of  the  community requires  that  the wrongdoer be not allowed  to go unwhipped of  justice but when  this  is accomplished, we must return the prisoner to society. INSANE ASYLUMS. For the condition of the various insane asylums of the State I refer you to the report of the trustees and of the supervisors of the insane.   Brattleboro. From  the  Supervisors’  report  we  learn  that  the  average  number  of  patients  at  Brattleboro  for  the  biennial term has been 428; that 185 have been removed to Waterbury and that there remained in this asylum on the 30th day of June, 1892, 348; of this number 199 are supported by the State.  By the removal of these patients to Waterbury there are now at Brattleboro vacant rooms for a large number of  inmates.  This  removal  gives  this  asylum  an  excellent  opportunity  for  the  erection  of  new  and  commodious buildings  for  the  better  care  of  certain  classes  of  patients  and  I  believe  it  is  in  contemplation  to  carry  these improvements to completion at no distant day. Waterbury. The  completion  of  a  portion  of  the  State  Asylum  at Waterbury  and  the  removal  to  it  of  a  large  number  of patients marks  a new  era  in  the  treatment  of  the  insane  in  this  state. By  the building of  this  asylum, devoted  to the care of the insane poor of the State, new responsibilities attach, that will for some years call for considerable appropriations for building purposes, as the wants of the State demand, without any of the financial benefits that accrue to the old asylum by reason of its private character. The  new  asylum  is  conveniently  and  pleasantly  located,  with  ample  grounds.  The  plan  of  the  buildings appears,  from  such  examination  I  have  been  able  to make,  to  be  well  adapted  for  the  purposes  for  which  they were originally designed but there are some doubts as to the adequacy of the heating and ventilating facilities. The  Supervisors  call  attention  to  the  overcrowding  of  the  new  asylum  the  buildings  already  erected  were originally designed, I am informed, for about 150 patients; but at one time, however, the number reached 207.  The number present on the 30th of June was 193. The reasons given for this overcrowding do not commend themselves  to  my  judgment;  questions  of  this  kind  should  not  be  decided  on  mercenary  grounds,  or  from pressure from any source. The kitchen,  laundry and store-rooms are  temporarily in  the basement; although  it would seem  that quarters could  have  been  arranged  in  temporary  buildings  in  the  rear  at  about  the  same  expense,  greatly  conducing  to health and comfort. An appropriation will be asked to complete the erection of the remaining buildings provided in the original plans. A  portion  or  all  of  the  administration  buildings  may  be  necessary,  but  the  silent  testimony  of  the  vacant wards in the old asylum does not point to any immediate or pressing need for dormitory facilities. INSANE POOR. Your  attention  is  called  to  the  laws  relating  to  the  insane  poor. Under  the  legislation  of  1886  the  burden  of supporting  the  insane  poor  has  been  shifted  from  the  town  to  the  State  without  adequate  means  for  enforcing good faith, under the provisions of the law, so that there are confined in the various asylums the poor and feeble who  are  the  proper wards  of  relatives,  or  towns,  and  ought  not  to  be  a  charge  upon  the State;  provision  should be  made  that  the  relatives  of  the  party  and  the  selectmen  of  the  town  should  be  examined  under  oath  and  the State’s  Attorney  or  other  suitable  person  obliged  to  make  a  careful  investigation;  and  after  the  person  is confined  in  the  asylum  inquiry  from  time  to  time  should  be  made  as  to  the  ability  and  duty  of  others  to participate in the support. It  is  believed  that  there  are  those  now  confined  in  the  asylums, who  have  had  property  fall  to  them  or who are,  of  themselves  able  to  pay,  this  being  concealed  or  property  withheld,  or  who  have  relatives  who  by  law should  contribute  their  share.  There  is  no  power  at  the  present  time  adequate  to  reach  these  and  other  cases, believed  to  be  improperly  charged  to  the  State.  It might  be well  to  enlarge  the  duties  of  the  supervisors  of  the insane  so  that  an  order  from  them  would  compel  the  State’s  Attorney  to  prosecute  a  claim  of  this  kind;  but  a more  effectual  way  of  reaching  this  is  by  compelling  the  towns  to  share  in  the  expense  of  supporting  their insane poor. The  amount  paid  by  the  State  for  the  support  of  this  class  of  patients  appear  to  have  been  $122,403.87  for the biennial term, to which is to be added the cost of maintaining those transferred to Waterbury. ROADS. The  legislation  of  1880  which  removed  from  the  towns  the  responsibility  for  having  good  roads,  has  in many  cases  caused  neglect  of  ordinary  obligations  and  fostered  abuse. With  the  tendency  of  the  times  to  shift financial burdens  from  the  town  to  the State Treasury,  towns are  tempted  to  set forth  their own neglect  in some instances as a reason why the State should aid in the support of highways in their communities. If the state is to assume supervision of the highways, then a State road commission should be formed to take the  whole  matter  in  charge;  and  even  if  the  State  is  simply  to  co-operate  with  the  different  towns  in  cases  of excessive  hardship  on  the main  lines  of  travel,  then  it  should  be made  obligatory  upon  the  State’s Attorney  of every county, to attend in person every hearing and protect the interests of the State. Good  roads  are  of  the  greatest  importance.  An  objection  against  the  present  custom  is,  that  it  is  without system or order, with a  total  lack of uniformity,  so  that  the  results  to a considerable extent are  seen and known by  the  people  only  when  the  biennial  report  of  the  State  Treasurer  is  published  and  the  demands  upon  the treasury, after  the money has been  spent, are made known  for  the  first  time.   Large  sums have been  spent, as  it appears by the State Treasurer’s report, during the biennial term, upon the public highways. Your attention  is called  to  the omission of  the  law  to provide  for any  suitable publication of  the conditions, circumstances or localities where this money has been expended. RAILROADS. The  act  of  1886  creating  a  board  of  railroad  commissioners  was  in  direct  response  to  the  public  demand. There  has  been  considerable  criticism  by  reason  of  what  might  be  termed  the  inadequacy  of  the  legislation. Each year  the  commissioners have  reported  the  results of  their doings  and  all have had  an opportunity  to  study the same to know the effect of the working of the law. The contemplation of  the  law  is  that the public may be able  to reach and  influence  the action of  the railroad corporations through the board, to the end that justice may be done without litigation. By reference to the last report of the commissioners we are informed that: ‘‘All complaints made have been acted upon by  the board, and  that  there has been no  refusal on  the part of the railroads to comply with their recommendations.” There has been considerable  reduction  in  freight  rates, whether equal  to  the  requirement of  the condition of our people or not I have no means of knowing, but all the people of the State who have any complaints to make against  the  railroads,  or  find  it  difficult  to  secure  those  privileges  which  they  believe  are  reasonable,  should freely  communicate  with  the  commissioners.  The  statement  of  the  commissioners  above  quoted  warrants  this confidence. Since  the act went  into operation nearly all of  the railroads  in  the State have very largely reduced passenger fares for single tickets and made mileages good to bearer. Some of the roads entering or operated from without the State have failed to comply with this demand of the public;  I  invite  your  attention,  therefore,  to  the  recommendations  heretofore  and  now  made  by  the  board, tending to strengthen their hands, to the end that none may escape from or fail in the performance of their duties to the public. By operation of the interstate commerce law the use of free passes has nearly ceased. I believe that the time has arrived when a law completing their abolishment would be cheerfully accepted. Wise legislation to prevent abuse is better than sumptuary laws to remove the same. MILITIA. There  is  provision  in  the  organic  law  for  the  maintenance  of  a  well-regulated  militia.  The  wisdom  and necessity  of  this  has  been  shown  on many  occasions. When  Sumpter was  fired  upon,  it was  four weeks  before Vermont put a regiment into the field; when the St. Albans raid occurred it was a still longer time, but since that time  the  State  has  kept  a  small  force  available  at  all  times.  Constantly  recurring  events  admonish  us  that  this cannot be neglected with safety. The National Guard of Vermont  consists  at  the present  time of  a brigade  formation with  three batallions of four companies each, organized as a  regiment, armed with 45 calibre Springfield  rifles, and one battery of  light artillery, armed with  four 3.2-inch S. B. L.  rifles. The gray uniform has been changed  to  the blue of  the  regular army, which  looks more  business-like  and  is  very  serviceable. This  expense will  not  have  to  be  incurred  again for some years, lessening to that extent the annual expenditure. The troops are well drilled and in every way a credit to the State. The various reports filed with the adjutant and  inspector  general  and  printed  with  his  report,  will  furnish  complete  and  detailed  information  concerning their present standing. An attempt will be made the coming year to secure the attendance at Chicago of the troops of all the States, together with the regular army of the United States. If you deem it best to grant the necessary permission, you can, by omitting the drills required in the State for the  year,  secure  this  without  any  increase  of  expense.  The  members  of  the  national  guard  bear  with  you  the burdens  of  government,  giving  from  one  to  four  weeks  each  of  their  time  per  annum,  without  remuneration. They  do  not  ask  for  or  look  with  favor  upon  increased  expense.    I  say  this  as  an  impression  gained  from  an intimate  association  with  them  of  many  years,  but  you  can  grant  with  propriety,  to  veterans  of  ten  or  twenty years of honorable service, upon their retirement, exemption from further jury duty. There  is  a  failure  in  the  law  to  provide  for  the muster  of  the men who  serve  in  the  national  guard. Suitable  officers should be designated to administer the oath. I  do  not  look  with  favor  upon  any  proposition  to  increase  the  number  of  infantry  or  artillery,  but  should patriotic  citizens  be  found  who  would  organize  a  company  of  Vermont  cavalry  and  support  the  same  without expense to the State, it would be well to encourage it. The Roster of Vermont Volunteers  in  the War of  the Rebellion, prepared under  the direction of  the adjutant and inspector general, is an excellent example of careful and painstaking work, reflecting credit upon the office; it will be of value to the State. SOLDIERS’ HOME. The Soldiers’ Home in Bennington has been further supplied with facilities by the construction of a suitable hospital, and  the erection of a chapel, funds for  the  latter having been obtained by subscriptions from friends of the soldier in the State. The report of the board shows that: 54 There have been admitted during the two years ending June 30, 1892 ....................................... 39 Discharged ................................................................................................................................... 15 Died .............................................................................................................................................. 49 Present number............................................................................................................................. 162 Whole number admitted ............................................................................................................... They ask for an appropriation of $18,000.  The report is so complete in all matters relating to the Home and the  care  of  its  inmates,  showing widespread  and  patriotic  interest  on  the  part  of  our  people,  that  it  is worthy  of careful study. GETTYSBURG. The work of marking the positions occupied by Vermont troops on the battlefield of Gettysburg, in the War of  the  Rebellion  has  been  carried  forward  by  one  of  the  regiments  engaged,  and  a  monument  erected  by  the surviving members and friends of the 16th Regiment, Col. Wheelock G. Veazey, commanding, which marks the advanced position occupied by this regiment in the culminating events of the last day of the battle. It  seems  fitting  that  special  mention  of  this  circumstance  should  be  made  at  this  time  in  order  that  the patriotic history of the State may be kept fresh in the minds of the people and perpetuated in public records. SALARIES OF STATE BOARDS. In  regard  to salaries of  trustees of public  institutions,  I am  reminded  that members of  the bar are compelled by  law  to  defend  criminals without  pay  in  some  cases;  that  the  savings  bank  trustees  in  the main  perform  their duties without pay;  the asylum at Brattleboro, and  the Soldier’s Home at Bennington are managed by men who freely give of  their  time  and  efforts  to  aid  in  this philanthropic work. May not Vermont  rely upon  such  service upon other of her boards? Men thus serving will confer high honor upon the State and in return be the recipients of  that  distinction  which  so  peculiarly  and  gracefully  attaches  to  those  associated  with  charitable  work,  a nobility which only can come from personal sacrifice and devotion. FISHERIES. From  the  report of  the  commissioners of  fisheries,  it will be  seen  that much  attention has been given  to  the proper enforcement of the laws already upon the statute books for the protection of fish and game. The benefits to be derived from the restocking of our streams and ponds will become more apparent with the advent of time, and consequently  there will be greater  temptation  to violate  the  laws. This must be met by vigorous action, and the wrong  doer  get  certain  punishment. Where  game  laws  are  clearly  understood,  public  sentiment will  sustain their  execution.  It  is  unfortunate,  therefore,  that  any  confusion  should  arise  upon  this  point,  and  I  invite  the careful  attention  of  the  legislature  to  the  report  of  the  commissioners,  to  the  end  that  all  uncertainty  may  be removed. The  slaughter  of  young  fish  not  over  a  finger’s  length  in  size,  by  strong,  able men,  is  not  a  pleasing  sight. For  such,  the  terrors  of  the  six-inch  law  were  provided,  and  it  should  remain  upon  the  statutes  if  the  work  of restocking the streams is to be made effectual. HATCHERY. The State Fish Hatchery  authorized  to be built has been  located  at Roxbury  and  a  small plant  erected,  from which during the past season 500 young fry have been turned over to the commissioners of fisheries and planted in  different  streams  in  the  State.  It  is  thought  that  at  least  double  the  number  can  be  obtained  from  the  same source  the  coming  season.  It  is  desirable  that  the  work  so  successfully  begun  may  be  continued.  The  present demand  for  good  fishing  is  far  beyond  the  natural  growth  and  if we would  secure  the  greatest  advantages  that are  afforded  by  our  numerous  waters,  splendid  locations  and  suitable  surroundings,  it  is  a  matter  of  ordinary business sagacity to continue the work so well begun. One method of popularizing game laws is to procure such an abundance of game that there may be a reasonable catch at all seasonable times.  With the completion of the hatcheries, provision should be made to turn the plant over to the commissioners of fisheries, that being, in my judgment, in the line of true economy. BOARD OF HEALTH. I call your attention to the report of the State Board of Health and  to  the  importance  of  strengthening  the laws concerning the public health. By reason of the unrestricted immigration from foreign nations, this country has recently realized the danger that accompanies the  same.  In  all  probability  the  alarm  from  this  state  of  things will  not  have  passed  for  some time; our own borders are exposed  to all  the dangers  incident  thereto.   With  the  removal of  the present  trouble, lax views may find lodgment and it is a matter of the highest importance that in so far as we may be exposed to external  danger,  there  should  be  adequate  power  lodged  with  the  Board  of  Health  to  meet  all  reasonable requirements. The provisions of the law giving the executive power to prohibit intercourse from without, in case of a great emergency, ought  to be extended  so as  to  include  a proper  regulation of communication, as circumstances may demand. In the face of a great epidemic or calamity, it is plain that nothing short of federal control of quarantine at all frontiers will be able to cope with the question, and for this State to attempt to set up independent control would be suicidal. It  should  be  the  duty  of  the  executive  to  co-operate  with  the  national  government  to  the  end  that  adequate measures may be adopted. In  this connection,  I do not  think  it  is out of place  to express  the hope  that  the national government may be able  at  no  distant  day  to  control  these  matters  in  such  a  way  that  our  people  will  be  free  from  the  dangers  to which they are constantly exposed by reason of unregulated immigration. REVISION OF LAWS. The  revision  of  the  laws  of  this  State  has  been  called  to my  notice  and  I  have  given  it  some  attention.   No doubt  a  new  revision would  be  convenient,  as  there  are  already  six  volumes  of  session  laws  to  be  examined  to get at the statutory law.  I am convinced, however, that good lawyers keep their statutes well annotated, and can with  reasonable  examination  determine  a  question,  and  in  view  of  the  expense,  a  new  revision  at  this  time  is hardly desirable. UNIFORM LAWS. The  necessity  for  uniform  laws  throughout  the  different  States  concerning  marriage,  divorce,  commercial paper, days of grace, the execution of conveyances of property by deed, by lease, and the descent of property to heirs, as well as other important matters, is receiving attention in many States. The  American  Bar  Association,  seeing  this  necessity,  has  recommended  that  the  States  appoint commissioners  to confer with each other  and  frame uniform  laws on  these various  subjects  and  submit  them  to their respective States.  Several have already appointed commissioners for the purpose indicated. I recommend to you that suitable provision be made for the appointment of a commissioner for this State. ELECTIONS. In  1890,  the  legislature  enacted  a  law  to  promote  purity  of  elections  and  secure  secrecy  of  the  ballot,  the better to enable every person who has a right to vote to express his will at the polls with precision and certainty. It was found necessary to make some amendments to this law at the special session in 1891. The  entire State has now had  a  trial of  the  same  and  you have  all had  an opportunity  to witness  and  test  its workings. Any  law  to  carry  out  these  measures  should  be  plain  and  simple  in  its  provisions,  without  complication, difficulty of execution or uncertainty as to results. That this law has operated to defeat the will of many voters, there can be no question. Many states that have tried  laws  similar  in  design  have  so  far  perfected  them  that  the  will  of  the  voter  is  easily  recorded,  and accurately and quickly ascertained. Every  voter  should  have  a  certain  and  easy  means  of  indicating  his  preference;  he  should  have  reasonable time and a suitable place in which to prepare his ballot, and ample opportunity to deposit the same. The  present  law  requires  such  an  amount  of  clerical  skill  that  a  voter,  in  spite  of  the  exercise  of  ordinary care, may be deprived of his franchise. Any  trifling  with  the  ballot  is  a  serious  matter.  The  sanctity  of  the  franchise  must  be  respected.  Your attention is called to the need of further legislation to perfect and carry out this reform. MUNICIPAL SUFFRAGE. For  several  years  the women of  this State have had  the  same  right  to  vote  as men  have  in  school meetings, the  same  right  as  men  have  to  hold  offices  relating  to  school  affairs  they  may  also  be  elected  to  the  office  of town clerk, and in some communities the people have availed themselves of this aid. Should  any  considerable  number  now  desire  that  the  right  be  extended  so  as  to  include  municipal  affairs, you will give the matter such consideration as in your judgment the subject may warrant.  UNITED STATES SENATOR. Upon the resignation of the Hon. George F. Edmunds as United States senator from this State, the Governor appointed  Hon.  Redfield  Proctor  to  fill  the  vacancy  occasioned  thereby,  until  the meeting  of  the  legislature.  It will be your duty to elect a successor to the present incumbent. The  act  of Congress  regulating  the  election  of  senators,  provides  for  such  elections  on  the  second  Tuesday of the session. BIENNIAL SESSION. One of  the  results of  the biennial system  is  the presence of  large numbers of new  legislators  in  the different branches,  and  the  consequent  increased  attention  and  study demanded  in  connection with  the various measures brought forward for consideration. It  is  no  uncommon  thing  for  an  agitation  to  be  prematurely  started  to  induce  the  legislature  to  complete  its work  and  return  home.  Ample  time  should  be  given  to  the  formation  of  the  different  committees,  thorough examination  should be made  into  the matters presented,  and  all  the deliberation accorded  to  the business of  the State that the circumstances require. It  is  not  the  amount  of  legislation  or  the  number  and  length  of  bills  that  become  laws,  so  much  as  their quality, that marks their importance for good or evil.  A state that is governed least is usually governed best, and a  few  good  laws  are  better  than  many  ill  considered  ones.  I  fear  the  State  has  sometimes  suffered  harm  by reason of haste and want of consideration in what at the time appeared to be harmless acts, but later we found to contain  the  necessary  material  for  the  doing  of  much  injury  and  sometimes  the  expenditure  of  considerable sums  of  money.  It  is  to  be  hoped,  therefore,  that  you  will  take  all  the  time  that,  in  your  judgment,  the  best interests of  the State  require;  to do a  faithful day’s work and  to perform  it as  far as possible  in  the daytime, not forgetting  that  the  executive  is  a  separate  department  of  the  government  and  is  entitled  to  reasonable  time  for the performance of official duties. While  the expense of keeping  the  legislature  in session  is considerable, we must not  forget  that  the demand for  modern  improvements  has  continued  to  press  with  increasing  importance  for  many  years,  and  in  the adjustment  from  the  old  to  the  new  it  is  not  always  easy  to  discern  whether  a  proposed  change  is  an improvement or not;  time  is required  to  test  these  things.  It becomes you,  therefore, unmoved by clamor of any sort,  but with  an  eye  single  to  the  public  good,  to  deliberately  investigate  the  results  so  far  as  they  are  known, and take such further action as may be required in the interests of good government. Four  hundred  years  ago  Columbus  braved  an  unknown  ocean  to  discover  a  continent,  setting  in  motion those  events  which  have  changed  the  face  of  the  political  world,  and  where  once  lived  a  few  children  of  the forest  and plain, we now  find prosperous nations with  teeming millions of  enlightened people. Then God  ruled nations by the will of the king; today he speaks his will by the voice of the people. To  commemorate  this  historic  and  important  event  Congress  has  provided  for  a  suitable  celebration  in  the city of Chicago. Provision has already been made by  law  for a  representation of  the  interests of  this State upon that occasion.  In  the  near  future  the  schools  of  the  land  will  gather  for  the  purpose  of  joining  in  special  commemorative exercises.  Within  the  last  few  years  the  great  importance  of  teaching  lessons  of  patriotism  has  so  impressed itself upon many  and  such  an  impetus been given  that  already  the  flag of our nation  floats  from many  a  school house throughout the land. This should not only be encouraged, but lessons of patriotism taught in the schools, and the text books, now far  too  silent upon  the  issues of military and patriotic events of  the country,  should  speak as plainly as possible concerning them that they may be accorded their rightful places in the hearts of the people. The  State  of  Vermont  has  entered  upon  the  second  century  of  her  existence,  the  anniversary  of  which  was celebrated  by  authority  of  an  act  of  the  legislature,  in  the  presence  of  the  governors  of  several  of  the States,  of the President of the United States and his cabinet, and large numbers of the people.  With  four  hundred  years  of  the  continent’s  history  and  a  century  of  statehood  behind  us,  with  all  its accumulated treasures of a Christian civilization, so well calculated to stimulate and fire the soul, and give hope of  a  bright  and  prosperous  future,  let  us  take  these  lessons  to  heart,  inspired  by  the  noblest  ambition  and worthiest  patriotism,  determined  to  make  the  most  of  our  blessings  and  to  carry  forward  those  interests  for which we  are  accountable,  realizing  the  full measure  of  our  responsibility,  seeking  divine  aid,  in  order  that we may reach the best possible solution of the problem committed to us. }EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, Montpelier, Vt., Oct. 6, 1892.
