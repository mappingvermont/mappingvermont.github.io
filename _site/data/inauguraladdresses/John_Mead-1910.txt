Inaugural address of  John A. Mead  As it appears in the  Journal  of the  JOINT ASSEMBLY  BIENNIAL SESSION  1910 Thursday, October 6, 1910 Inaugural Message Gentlemen of the Senate ad House of Representatives.: In  accordance  with  the  custom  of  our  fathers  and  in  harmony  with  the  constitution  of  our  State,  you  are convened  in  General  Assembly  for  the  performance  of  a  sacred  duty,  for  the  faithful  fulfillment  of  which  you have each taken a solemn oath. The conditions of society are of such a nature  in our State,  that certain restrictions or  laws are necessary for the betterment  and happiness of mankind;  that  justice, honor and  fair dealing  should govern,  so  far  as possible, the  affairs  of  the  people  of  our  State.    It  is  for  the  consideration  of  such  laws  that  you  are  convened.  It  is  a solemn obligation which you have sought and which has been delegated to you by your constituents. The  most  perfect  system  of  government  the  wisdom  of  the  ages  has  devised,  is  that  contained  in  our  own constitution,  which  expressly  provides  that  the  three  co-ordinate  departments—the  “law-making  power,’’  the “law-executing  power’’  and  the  “law  expounding  power”—shall  be  kept  separate  and  distinct,  and  that  neither shall attempt to exercise the rights which belong to the other. To  you,  the  chosen  representatives  of  our  people;  is  delegated  the  high  duty  and  exclusive  privilege  of  all legislation. At this time, we should bear in mind that Vermont has no seaports or deep waterways, but, strictly speaking, is  an  inland  State,  and  that  certain  rules  or  laws  which  might  greatly  work  for  the  betterment  of  conditions  in other communities differently situated, might prove unfortunate for the government of our people. On  the  other  hand,  I  feel  that  Vermont  is  blessed  to  a  greater  degree  than  any  other  of  the  New  England States,  and,  indeed,  it  may  well  be  said  that  Vermont,  considering  her  size,  if  favored  to  as  great  a  degree  by nature as any state in our Union. Nature has dealt with our State in the most generous manner. By  referring  to  the  report of our Commissioner of Agriculture, we are  informed  that Vermont nearly equals all  the other New England States  together  in  the production of dairy products, being  the only State whose cows near equal in numbers it in habitants. In the splendor of our scenery, our mountains and valleys, our rivers and lakes are unexcelled in variety and beauty,  and  these  afford  an  asset which  should  be  fully  appreciated  by  our  legislature,  that  our  people may  be enabled to realize all the benefits which should easily and naturally inure from this source. In addition, we should not forget the natural wealth and extent of our stone products. The General Assembly is the supreme law-making power of the State and within its jurisdiction there should be no interference by the Executive nor attempted influence by private interests. A  time-honored custom, however, directs  that I submit for your consideration a few suggestions concerning some of the larger questions and more important problems, which as experience has demonstrated, and changed conditions now demand, should require your attention at this session, and it is in obedience to that custom that I now call your attention to and recommend for your serious and patriotic action the subjects that are to follow. AGRICULTURE. This small  territory  in which we  live and which we  love so dearly and of which we  feel so  justly proud and call  Vermont,  is  greatly  blessed  in  many  respects,  and  especially  in  the  wealth  of  her  soil.  As  farmers  we  are just  realizing  this  inheritance,  but  surely  we  have  not  availed  ourselves  of  the  best  knowledge  of  agricultural life, for the reason that it has not been easily available. Large sections of our State testify to this fact. The agricultural products of our State in certain large areas can be easily doubled, but this can only be done by a greater knowledge of agricultural pursuits Agricultural life occupies nearly two-thirds of all our people and thus is by far the most important of all our industries,  and  yet,  if  I  read  our  legislative  history  correctly,  less  has  been  done  to  encourage  and  further  the wellbeing of the farmer than any other considerable class. The Agricultural College is rendering special assistance to agriculture, but its service is crippled by absence of an opportunity to illustrate fully its wisdom to the farmers; still, much has been accomplished by our college. But,  if  I  am  advised  correctly,  very  few  of  its  students  ever  return  to  the  old  farm  for  permanent  employment, The  college  has  been  and  is  doing  a  good  work,  but  there  is  a  general  desire  on  the  part  of  our  progressive farmers  for  some  provision  for more  general  and  practical  instruction.  I  am  informed  that Vermont  is  the  only State  in  our  union  largely  interested  in  agricultural  pursuits  which  has  not  even  one  agricultural  school  where thorough,  practical  farming  is  taught.  If  agricultural  life  is  in  fact  the  most  important  of  all  our  pursuits—the corner  stone  of  our  prosperity—and  absolutely  essential  to  our  growth  and  continuance,  no  effort  should  be spared to better these conditions, and to encourage and lighten the burden of agricultural life in our State. Much has been accomplished but there are ample opportunities for improvement along these Lines. That you may realize more fully the vast importance of agricultural life in our country, I quote briefly a few statistics,  referring  to  the  volume  of  farm  products  in  these  United  States,  which  are  simply  beyond  human comprehension. The  corn  crop  of  our  country  in  1907  was  worth,  at  the  market  price  $1,350,000,000;  our  hay  crop, $660,000,000; our cotton crop, $675,000,000; our wheat crop, $500,000,000, aggregating over 3000 millions in one year. We  hear  fabulous  reports  of  the wealth  of  our  gold  and  silver mines,  but  if  our  statistics  are  correct,  either one of  the  four  leading  agricultural products of our  country  exceed  in value  all  the gold  and  silver produced  in all  the  world  each  year.  Such  are  only  a  few  of  the  many  facts  which  are  available,  but  they  are  sufficient  to illustrate  the value of agricultural  life  in our country, and  if  two-thirds of  the people of Vermont are engaged  in these pursuits such facts should stimulate this legislature to attempt the most progressive legislation along these lines. Not  only  would  an  agricultural  high  school  course  more  fully  develop  the  rich  resources  of  Vermont  and thus  largely  increase  the  agricultural  products,  but  for  those who would  engage  in  an  agricultural  life  it would lead  to  an  education  thoroughly  practical.  By  this means  we  should  in  one  short  generation  develop  a  class  of practical and scientific farmers. I  therefore  recommend  that  the  present  General  Assembly  establish  one  or  more  agricultural  schools,  with all the necessities and advantages which should pertain thereto. THE WORTHLESS DOG. While considering agricultural life, I cannot refrain from referring to one of the special evils or pests of farm life, viz., The Worthless Dog. Personal experience of a most disappointing character and a careful study of farm life  conditions  in  our  county  for  the  last  eight  years,  have  convinced  me  that  the  worthless  dogs  of  our  towns and cities have driven  the  sheep  from our hillsides and  forced upon our  farmers  the keeping almost exclusively of  cattle.  One  of  the  most  successful  breeders  of  Spanish  Merino  sheep  in  our  section,  after  having  spent twenty-five  years  in  perfecting  his  flock, was  compelled  to  dispose  of  the  remnant  and  substitute  cattle  though not  till he had  shot on his premises  the  seventy-fourth dog chasing his  sheep. This may be an unusual case, but with us there are many others suffering from the same evil. The  result  of  this  plethory  of  cattle  in  our  State  has  forced  most  of  our  farmers  to  the  production  of  dairy products wholly,  and  in  such  quantities  that  less  than  one-third  are  consumed  at  home,  and  the  remaining  two-thirds must seek a foreign market at a greatly reduced price.. The  farmer working on a  large  scale  realizes  fully  the difficulty of obtaining proper help  for dairy purposes but he too often is forced to this task, as he cannot safely devote his energies to the raising and herding of sheep. The  results of  this  evil may be more  severely  felt  in  certain  sections  than  in others, but my attention of  late has frequently been called to this subject, and the farmers in Rutland County are earnestly asking for relief. Our  laws do not  and  should not permit  the keeping of dogs or other  animals  that may be  a  cause of  serious financial injury or damage to our people.   I  would  recommend  to  this  assembly  the  serious  consideration  of  this  subject;  the  continuance  of  a reasonable  tax on dogs,  the compelling of wearing a collar as at present, with  the owner’s name plainly marked thereon,  and,  in  addition,  requiring  each  owner  of  a  dog  to  deposit  a  bond with  the  city  or  town  clerk  of  $100, more  or  less,  which  must  be  maintained  at  this  amount  with  one  or  more  sufficient  sureties.  Thus  an  injured party could at once realize for his loss, so soon as he could prove the ownership of the offending dog. Some  statute  to  this  effect  drawn  properly  and  fearlessly  enforced  would  rid  our  state  of  the  more undesirable half of our dogs at once, and if this law could be made effective it would inure greatly to the benefit of our farmers, and to the large increase of sheep herding in our State. In  this  connection,  it  may  not  be  out  of  place  for  me  to  call  attention  to  the  failure  of  local  officials  to enforce  our  present  laws  requiring  the  killing  of  all  dogs  not  licensed  and  collared.  No  law  can  be  effective unless it is enforced. FORESTRY. During  the  last  few years  the  subject of  forestry has been  attracting  increased,  attention  from  those  citizens who have the best interest of our State at heart. No  argument  is  necessary  at  this  time  to  convince  our  people  of  the  great  good  to  be  accomplished  by  the practice  of  forestry,  so  called.  The  only  question  is,  in  what manner  can  the  best  results  be  attained?  Our  first forestry  Law  of  any  importance  was  enacted  in  1904,  designed  to  protect  our  forests  from  fires.  This  law  has served  its  purpose  reasonably  well,  though  it  is  thought  that  amendments  could  be  made  which  would  help  to more thoroughly accomplish this object. Our people may feel justly proud of our advancement, in this held as, with only four years’ experience, there is  only  one State with  a  larger  nursery  than  has Vermont.  I  learn  from Professor Hawes  and Mr. Hitchcock,  of Pittsford to both of whom I am indebted for many facts, that there are now growing on land furnished freely by the  State  University  about  three  million  seedlings.    It  was  in  1906  that  the  law  was  passed  establishing  this nursery  for  forestry  seedlings,  and  not  until  1908  did  the  State  obtain  the  services  of  a  professionally  trained Forester. In  addition  the  State  has  250,000  seedlings  growing  at  Sharon,  on  land  generously  donated  to  the  State  by Mr. Chas. Downer  for  forestry purposes,  and  about 250,000 were  sold  and  transplanted  in 1909,  and 375,00  in 1910, and it is expected that 600,000 of these young trees will be distributed in 1911. These trees are sold to our people at their cost, which is about one-half of what they would cost from any other source.   They are scattered all over our State and the results in a few years will be most beneficial and far-reaching. Our State has  two  reserves, and  it  should be  the policy of  the Legislature  to provide a method by which  the State can acquire, through the State Forester, additional lands, by gift if possible, and occasionally by purchase. Our  people  do  not  appreciate  as  they will,  the  influence  of  these  reserves  upon  the  public  health,  upon,  the local  lumber market,  upon  the  beauty of our  scenery  and upon our water  supply. They  serve  all  these purposes and others, whose influences will be potent in the development of our State. I respectfully ask your consideration to two practical questions relating to forestry. First. Can  the method of  taxing the timber lands of our State be revised, so as to encourage  the preservation and growth of our forests? Second, Shall the State share in a small way in protecting our larger lumber tracts from fires? The  suggestion  has  been made  that  the  State  should  establish  fish  and  game  preserves  in  different  parts  of the State,  upon which  fish  and  game  can  be  allowed  to propagate  freely  scattering  thence  over  the  surrounding country.  I  see no  reason why  some  of  the money  available  for  the protection of  fish  and game  and  some of  the money appropriated for forestry cannot be united in the establishment of forest reserves which shall at the same time  be  “game  preserves,’’  and  under  the  joint  control  of  the  State  Forester  and  the  State  Commission  of  Fish and Game. CATTLE COMMISSION One of the most difficult problems of state government is that which pertains to our Cattle Commission and more  especially  to  tuberculous  cattle,  as  the  vast  amounts  of  money  being  paid  to  the  owners  of  cattle slaughtered  by  order  of  our  Cattle  Commission  during  each  biennial  term  is  an  enormous  drain  on  our  state treasury and there are grave doubts as to the amount of benefit that has been realized. During  the  year  ending  June  30,  1909,  there  was  expended  by  this  Commission  nearly  $100,000,  of  this nearly $80,000 was paid to owners of tuberculous cattle killed by order of your Commissioner. By the Auditor’s report  I  note  also  that  for  the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  1910,  there  was  paid  on  orders  by  your  Cattle Commissioner  $50,128.67.  This  second  amount  is  much  less  than  for  the  previous  year,  as  the  Legislature  of 1908 limited the amount that could be used annually for this purpose to $40,000 and the amounts received from the slaughtered animals, making the total expenditure for this period, as stated, $50,128.67.  These expenditures have  continued  for  twelve  years,  and  still  the  amount  expended  during  the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  1909, exceeds any other for a like period. The  details  of  this Act  of  1908  are without  doubt  familiar  to  you  and  I will  not  further  consider  them.  The thought which prompts my reference to this subject is, are you exterminating this dreaded disease by the means now  employed?  The  figures  taken  from  the  Auditor’s  report  would  not  indicate  this  result.  Are  you  not continually  spending  this  large  amount  annually without  any  apparent  results  in  diminishing  this  disease? You are  all  aware  that  in  this  age  human  beings  are made  immune  to  certain  diseases The  vaccine  virus  is  used  the world  over  as  protection  from  small  pox. Antitoxin  obtained  from  the  horse  an  animal  immune  to  ditheria,  has saved  thousands  of  human  lives.  Is  there  not  some  form  of  virus  that  can  be  obtained  which,  under  favorable conditions,  may  render  our  cattle  kind  immune  to  tuberculosis?  Many  of  our  progressive  farmers  are  already advised  that  there  is  such  a virus,  that  is being  thoroughly  tested  at  this  time,  and  in  fact  a  few  in  our State  are using a virus with very satisfactory results. If our efforts to eradicate the “white plague’’ from our cattle kind by the methods adopted and executed during the  last fourteen years, and after an expenditure of many hundreds of thousands  of  dollars  in  killing  the  old  cows,  have  not  proved  effective,  is  it  not  opportune  for  you  to  consider some  efforts  beginning  at  the  other  end  of  the  line?  If  the  calves  can  be  made  immune  and  kept  so,  in  a  few years the conditions as to this affection ought to be greatly improved and the disease nearly eradicated. Common  business  sense  demands  that  this  enormous  annual  expenditure  shall  cease  unless  it  can  be demonstrated more conclusively than has yet been done that we are obtaining commensurate results. There  is  another  thought which  I wish  to  present  and which  is  intimately  connected with  this  subject,  viz., the  care  of  our  cattle.  Are  our  present  methods  the  best,  realizing  how  susceptible  cattle  are  to  tuberculous infection? The custom generally prevailing is to confine the cattle in stables too often poorly ventilated and with deficient  light,  and  in  sufficient  numbers  to  be  most  injurious,  so  that  if  there  was  the  slightest  opportunity  to contract the disease, they would all become affected Cattle were  evidently  created  for outdoor  life;  their hoofs,  thick  skins  and heavy  coats  all  indicate  this  fact. It  is  a  well  known  fact  that  cattle  kind  readily  contract  tubercular  disease;  and  why  should  not  the  same treatment  be  applied  to  them  that  benefits  human  kind?  It  is  now  a well  established  fact  that  the most  efficient remedy  for  this  affection  in  human  beings  is  pure  air,  and  should  not  the  same  conditions  apply  to  our  cattle? Our progressive  farmers  are  awakening  to  this  fact and more good  sheds opening  to  the south or  east  are being used every year.  If our State is to join with the farmers in an effort to free Vermont cattle of this plague, should they not exercise good judgment and the care of their cattle? I  therefore  recommend  to  this  assembly  that  your  Cattle  Commissioner  be  authorized  to  thoroughly investigate the subject of rendering calves immune, with power to furnish and use the virus until a thorough trial has been made, at the expense of the State. I also recommend that you clothe such commissioner with authority to prescribe rules regulating the care of cattle  where  the  State  furnishes  aid,  particularly  in  requiring  the  use  of  comfortable  sheds,  well—ventilated stables and pure water. If the State is to assume some portion of the expense of keeping cattle free from disease, it should have a certain supervision in the care of these animals. I have  tabulated  and hereto  attach  a detailed  statement of  the  expenditures  since  July 1, 1898, by  the Cattle Commissioner.

The  annual  appropriation  of Fifty  Thousand  Dollars  by  the  State  for  highway  purposes  in  1906  was  increased  to  Seventy-five  Thousand Dollars in 1908; and for the towns to benefit by this appropriation, they must contribute a like amount. This fact has stimulated the town officials to greater endeavors than ever before. Our  people  are  fast  learning  that  our  public  highways  are  the  avenues  of  travel  and  of  commerce,  and  are nearly equal  in  their  importance  to our  railroads. They are, as  it were,  the arteries of our social and commercial system,  reaching  out  into  our  country  and  gathering  the  products  of  our  farms  and mills,  and  transferring  them to our rail way stations and to commercial centers. It  is becoming more evident every day  that good highways are  indispensable  to our commercial growth and wellbeing.  Our  people  are  fast  learning  that  it  is  the  surplus  from  our  farms  and  mills  which  we  sell  that increases our wealth;  it  is not  that which we  consume;  and  thus  the cost of  transportation and distribution  is an important factor; and if it is too expensive, the products of our farms and mills are valueless. The discussion of this subject could be continued indefinitely. The  effects  of  good  roads  upon  our  educational  life  is  self  evident  and  too  apparent  to  require  discussion, Easy  and  cheap  transportation  to  and  from  our  schools  is  of  the  greatest  importance  arid  the  same  arguments pertain to our churches and to all social life. The  automobiles  have  come  to  stay  and  must  be  reckoned  with  in  highway  problems,  and  they  are contributing largely to the construction and maintenance of our roads. Great as are the benefits of good roads, I can but feel that we are adopting a safe and businesslike method in dealing with this subject. I cannot feel that our people are ready to bond our State for trunk highways, so-called. The  improvements  during  the  last  four  years  are  great  and  another  two  years  will  certainly  show  still  greater progress  along  this  line,  and  if  the  appropriation  could  be  quite  considerably  increased,  and  I  think  it  can  be, with no fear of a State tax, the improvement will be that much the more. The report of our Commissioner of Highways has been published and is before you, and I urge your careful consideration  of  the  same,  and  especially  of Mr.  Gates’  recommendations,  the  first  of  which  refers  to  a  larger appropriation by this legislature; and in this I earnestly concur. TAXATION. The effort to devise a more satisfactory system of taxation than that now on our statute books, has occupied the  time  of  your  last  two  legislatures  to  a  greater  extent  than  any  other  subject  and  still  but  little  or  no advancement  has  been  attained.  The  Commission  appointed  in  1906,  after  two  years  of  careful  consideration, gave  your  assembly  a most  complete  and  instructive  report,  and  this was  submitted  to  the Legislature  of  1908, but  no  definite  results  we  attained,  and  again  we  find  the  same  plank  in  the  Republican  State  Platform, demanding  further  consideration  and  action  as  to  tax  reform—more  particularly  to  remedy  the  evils  of  double taxation,  so  called,  and,  again,  to  “impose  the  burden  of  support  of  the  government  equitably  among  all men.” Surely every gentleman present has promised to use his best endeavors to accomplish this purpose. Your are all agreed  that  some  changes  should  be made,  but  it  is  difficult  to  determine  how  far  and  in what manner  the  evil can be remedied. The  levying of a  tax upon  real estate on an appraisal  representing  its  fair cash value  is generally considered as  equitable,  but  the  system  of  taxing  all  personal  property  at  the  same  rate  as  that  levied  upon  real  estate  is subjected  to  severe  criticism. Modern  authorities  on  taxation  favor  the  division  of  personal  property  into  such classes that varying rates may be imposed thereon. In  States wherein  such  classifications  have  been  adopted,  tangible  personal  property  like  live  stock,  stocks in  trade,  lumber  and  machinery,  are  usually  subject  to  the  same  tax  rate  as  the  real  estate;  and  intangible personal  property  like  loans,  bonds,  mortgages  and  credits,  which  are  simply  an  evidence  of  property  and nothing more, are taxed at a much lower rate. Many  states  have  constitutions  that  prohibit  such  varying  classifications,  and  a  general movement  is  being made to eliminate those constitutional provisions, requiring that all property, personal and real, must be taxed at the same rate and in the same manner, The  constitution  of  Vermont  contains  no  express  provisions  requiring  an  uniformity  of  taxation;  but  the question of whether or not the effect of the language employed therein prohibits uniform taxation is raised in the case of State vs. Clement National Bank now pending in our Supreme Court. For nearly  thirty years our State has  reserved  for  its own  revenue  certain  classes of property and  taxpayers, and exempted them from town and county taxation, e. g., deposits in savings banks and trust companies; and the property  of  railroad,  transportation,  express,  car,  telephone  and  telegraph  companies.  No  two  of  these corporations  are  taxed  upon  the  same  basis,  and  yet  each  contributes  approximately  in  fair  proportion  to  the support of the State government. The  increase, during  the past  ten years of substantially one hundred per cent  in  the amount of bank deposits subject  to  the  State  tax  of  seven-tenths  of  one  per  cent,  or  seven  dollars  per  thousand,  demonstrates  the advisability of allowing a lower rate on intangible personal property than is imposed upon real estate. A  like  tax  on  notes,  bonds  and  other  securities  held  by  individuals would  doubtless materially  increase  the amount reported for taxation and largely increase the revenue derived front this source. In thus reducing the tax rate  on  notes  secured  by  mortgage,  from  the  local  rate  to  seven-tenths  of  one  per  cent,  or  seven  dollars  per thousand,  it would  to  that  extent more  than  one-half  relieve  the  evil  effects of double  taxation;  and  should  also affect materially the rate of interest at which loans from individuals might be obtained. It  should  be  the  policy  of  Vermont  to  keep  her  taxation  laws  as  nearly  as  possible  abreast  of  the  times;  to correct  any  feature  therein  that  works  injustice  or  permits  evasion  of  taxation;  and  to  invest  listers  with  such reasonable powers and support as will enable them to obtain just and fair results. Too  radical  legislation would be unwise, but  earnest  effort  to bring  about  some of  the most needed  reforms in methods and administration are demanded by our people. I  do  therefore  recommend  that  the  same  rate  of  taxation  be  imposed  upon  intangible  personal  property  like loans  bonds,  credits  and  mortgages  on  property  within  our  State  as  that  levied  upon  deposits  in  our  savings banks. I would  also  recommend  that  our  statutes  be  so  amended  as  to  “provide  for  State  central  authority  in  some form that shall have a proper degree of authority and oversight of the administration of the laws in our cities and towns.’’  relating  to  taxation.  Your  Commissioner  of  Taxes  might  be  invested  with  this  authority  or  a  special commission be appointed for this purpose. LEGISLATION PERTAINING TO WAG EARNERS Both of the dominant parties of our State have promised certain forms of what is known as labor legislation, and  this  Legislature  will  not,  I  trust,  fail  to  make  good  these  promises.  I  do  not  favor  what  is  known  as  class legislation,  but  if  the Assembly  has  enacted  laws  favoring  the  farmers,  and  the members  of  all  the  professions, there  is  no  good  reason  for  refusing  the  same  or  similar  benefits  to  the  wage  earners,  who  are  far  less  able  to endure the misfortunes of life. If it is your wish to avoid the worst forms of socialism and anarchism, let us treat all  classes  alike—for  these  and  many  other  reasons  I  trust  the  “ten  dollar”  exemption  bill  will  receive  your favorable  consideration. Both parties  are  committed  to  the  same promises  as  to  the Employer’s Liability Bill.  I will  not  detain  you  by  repeating  the  arguments  advanced  in  behalf  of  this  measure.  The  public  press  has reiterated  them  time  and  again,  and during  the  last  campaign both parties were obligated  to  this measure,  and  I earnestly recommend that this obligation be kept, and that the legislation promised be enacted. There  is  another  labor  question,  so  called, which  I  trust will  receive  attention  by  this  assembly,  viz:,  a  law providing  for  some  equitable  form  of  arbitration  in  labor  difficulties,  and  my  suggestion  would  be,  some enactment  similar  to  the  Canadian  law.  I  believe  that  some  effective  legislation  along  this  line  would  inure greatly to the mining and manufacturing industries of our State, and to the laborers as well. The  question  may  arise  as  to  the  constitutionality  of  this  latter  measure,  and,  if  so,  this  would  be  an opportune time for the consideration of this subject. EDUCATION. There  is  no  subject  of  more  vital  importance  to  the  welfare  and  betterment  of  our  State  than  that  of  the education  of  our  children. A  State  is  not  esteemed most  for  its wealth  nor  its  rapid  increase  in  population,  nor for  its  physical  attractions  or  natural  resources,  hut  it  is  prized  and  respected  above  all  for  the  intelligence  and character  of  its  people.  That  they  might  better  promote  these  and  render  each  succeeding  generation  better equipped for its life work than its predecessor, our fathers provided for a system of free public education. For  many  years  every  Legislature  has,  endeavored  to  do  something  to  strengthen  our  educational  system, and it remains for the Assembly of 1910 to contribute to the work and offer to the children of our State the best advantages possible along educational lines. The  children  are  the  subjects  of  our  ambition,  and  the  teacher  is  the  instrument  for  their  betterment.  If  the teacher is not fully equipped for the task, what are the results? My fear is that our system is the weakest where it should be the strongest, namely, in its teachers in our rural schools. Vermont  employs  a  larger  percentage  of  untrained  teachers  than  any  other  New  England  State,  the percentage being about 78 percent, more than three-fourths of our teachers, then, are untrained. In Rhode Island, on the other hand, less than one-third of the teachers are not trained for their work. Our  fathers were  proud  of  the  fact  that  as  to  the  education  of  her  children, Vermont  of  all  the  States  in  the Union,  was  second  only  to  Massachusetts,  but  today  we  have  fallen  to  a  discreditably  low  rank  and  are  on  a level with some of the Southern states. These  facts do not make pleasant  reading, but  they  are  facts, and we cannot alter  them by  closing our  eyes. The  time  has  come  when  we  must  look  the  situation  squarely  in  the  face;  find  out  the  trouble  and  begin  to remedy it at its source. Upon one  thing, all who have  investigated  the educational conditions  in Vermont are agreed, viz.:  if we are to  keep  pace  with  the  progress  of  other  States,  and  indeed  if  we  are  not  to  actually  retrograde,  the  standard  of our  rural  schools  must  be  decidedly  raised.  And  the  standard  of  these  schools  depends  largely  upon  the efficiency of the teachers in them, The trouble at present is not in the character and natural ability of the teachers in our country schools, but in their lack of training. Reference has already been made to the very large percentage of untrained teachers in our schools  today.  In  this  age  of  special  training  for  every  pursuit,  there  is  not  another  walk  in  life  here  such  a condition would he tolerated, and yet the education of our children lies at the foundation of all progress The  difficulty  with  our  present  situation,  which  at  once  presents  itself,  is  the  lack  of  training  facilities  for those who wish to become teachers. Our normal schools,  three  in number, draw  their pupils  to a  large extent from  the communities  immediately around  them, and  the effect  is  shown  in  the percentage of  trained  teachers  in  the  rural schools  in different parts of the State. For example, in Rutland County, where one of the Normal Schools is situated, excluding the city of Rutland and West Rutland, the percentage of trained teachers is four times as great as in Windham County, which has no normal school excluding Brattleboro and Rockingham. A large percentage of the pupils in attendance at each of the Normal Schools is drawn from the town in which they are situated and the towns immediately around them. It  is no more  than  fair,  then,  to other parts of  the State, and  it  is absolutely necessary,  if we are  to bring our schools  throughout  the  State  up  to  anything  like  an  even  standard,  provision  should  be  made  for  training teachers in each section. Excellent results have been obtained in other States by establishing training courses in connection with high schools and academies under the supervision and direction of the State Department of Public Instruction. I  therefore  recommend  that  the  Legislature  appropriate  a  sufficient  sum  to  establish  training  courses  in  the principal  high  schools  and  academies,  where  the  towns’  are  willing  to  co-operate  by  contributing  in  a  proper proportion  to  their maintenance, giving  to  the State  the  immediate control and  supervision of  these courses and the  power  to  determine  where  they  shall  be  installed  and  how  long  continued.  With  but  little  expense,  the number  of  trained  teachers  in  the  rural  schools  by  this means  can  be  easily  doubled,  if  not  increased  fourfold. School Boards will pay better salaries,  if  they are sure of competent  teachers,  thus helping  to overcome another difficulty we have to contend with in the low wage scale for teachers. Our people will be only too willing to pay for results when they can be obtained. But these teacher training courses should not be our only reliance. We need to supplement these with a high grade  normal  school,  centrally  located,  and  completely  under  state  control  one  which  will  set  the  pace  for  the entire State, and which will take rank with the best schools of the kind anywhere. The best is none too good for us where the education of our children is concerned. The State  is at present contributing  to  the support of  three normal schools  in different parts of  the State and has been doing  so  for more  than 30 years. From 1870 down  to 1908  every  committee  appointed  to  report upon the  matter,  so  far  as  I  have  been  able  to  learn,  has  unanimously  found  that  the  present  system  has  proven inadequate to the State’s need, In  1870,  only  three  years  after  the  establishment  of  the  first  school,  the  board  of  education,  composer  of Governor Hendee, Hon. Merritt Clark, Rev. William A. Robinson, D. D., Hon.  Jonathan Ross, L. F, Ward  and Prof. George Webber, made a comprehensive report, from which I quote as follows: “It  became  obvious  to  the  Board  that  the  present  system. while  accomplishing  all  that  could  reasonably  be excepted  of  it, was  proving  itself  entirely  inadequate  to  the wants  of  the State,  and  as  a  permanent  system was unworthy of any State that aimed to make liberal provision toward public education. “In  fact  it  seems  to  have  been  taken  for  granted  from  the  outset  that  the  present  plan  was  to  be  only  an entering wedge and that something larger and better was of course to follow,’’ Thirty-six years subsequent to this report the Legislature of 1906 appointed a Committee, consisting of Hon. Frank L. Green, Supt. Clarence II. Dempsey, Bert L. Stafford. Hon. L. Ethelbert Sherwin and Willis N. Cady, to investigate  and  report  upon  the  present  condition  of  our  State  Normal  Schools.  To  their  report  I  would respectfully call your attention. Their conclusion was: “The present Normal Schools do not adequately meet the educational needs of the times.” Following  this  the Legislature of 1908 passed  an  act providing  for  a  commission  to  investigate and prepare plans  for  a  central  normal  school.  The  commission  for  some  reason  was  not  appointed,  but  the  act  shows  the conclusion of the legislature. It is apparent that the State needs something more than the present normal schools can give. The appropriations have doubled  in the  last  ten years and now amount  to $30,000 a year, yet  the number of graduates for the decade has not appreciably increased and in two schools has in fact decreased. In  considering  the  question  of  increasing  our  normal  school  facilities,  it  should  also  be  borne,  in mind  that the  plant  and  buildings  of  the  present  normal  schools  are  owned  and  controlled  entirely  by  self-perpetuating boards of  trustees  in  two  instances,  and by  the  principal of  the  school  in  the  other. The State  has  no  ownership in  or  control  over  them.  This  is  probably  one  thing  that  has  held  back  their  proper  development,  or  common business  sense  forbids  the  State  to make  any  large  investment  to  improve  property which  it  does  not  own  and control absolutely. I  recommend  that  this  Legislature  appropriate  a  suitable  sum  for  the  establishment  of  a  centrally  located State Normal School  to be entirely under  the control and ownership of  the State, and  that a board be appointed with  power  to  locate  and  establish  the  same,  For  this  board,  we  should  be  content  with  only  the  very  best qualified  men  in  our  State  in  educational  matters  who  will  make  their  decisions  entirely  unmoved  by partisanship or local prejudices and with an eye solely to the good of the whole State. The question  is not, as  it has often been made  to appear,  the abolishment of present normal schools, but  the increase of normal facilities. It stems to be the consensus of opinion that the State ought to he doing more than it is, and  that  the first step  is  the establishment of a see State “Normal School.”   The present normal schools may also  be  continued,  if  they  can  prove  their  efficiency  and  fill  a  place  in  our  educational  system,  as  I  hope  they can. The  school  at  Randolph,  by  reason  of  the  lack  of  pupils  near  by,  is  the  least  able  to  do  good  normal  work and  has  the  least  prospect  of  improvement. On  the  other  hand,  it  is  admirably  situated  for  an  agricultural  high school,  and,  if  the  State  could  obtain  ownership  of  the  property,  I  should  favor  the  establishment  there  of  a completely equipped first class agricultural school, I  leave  these  matters  to  your  careful  consideration  and  simply  ask  that  the  subject  be  approached  with  an open and unprejudiced mind and in a broad and patriotic manner. Being careful to do no injustice, let us see to it that nothing prevents us from giving our children the very best advantages that can be had, CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. Some  few  weeks  since,  in  accepting  the  high  honor  which  the  last  Republican  Convention  conferred  upon me,  I  referred  briefly  to  the  proposed  constitutional  amendments,  and,  at  that  time,  fully  concurred  with  the suggestions submitted by the committee appointed to consider this important subject. It  is  not my  purpose  at  this  time  to  discuss  in  detail  the  eight  amendments  proposed.  They  have  been  fully dealt with in the public press, during the last two months, and the arguments pro and con must be too familiar to you all to warrant further reference at this time. I  appreciate  fully  the  sacredness  of  our  constitution,  of  how  carefully  it  should  be  guarded  and  with  what wisdom  and  deliberation  we  should  act  in  changing  the  same.  I  also  realize  that  we  are  living  in  another  age from  that  in which our constitution was  framed and  thus subject  to changed conditions—that  the constitution  is the  work  of  man  and  not  infallible,  I  earnestly  recommend  a  careful  consideration  of  each  of  the  eight amendments. I  would  also  recommend  an  amendment  that  would  so  govern  our  election  of  town  Representatives  and county  Senators  that,  at  each  session  of  our  Legislature,  at  least      one-third  or  one-half  of  their  number  shall have  had  legislative  experience.  I  know  of  no  amendment  that  would  more  efficiently  hasten  the  work  of  the General Assembly. PRIMARY ELECTIONS—WEIGHTS AND MEASURES These are subjects which should receive your earnest attention. They have been kept before  the public most industriously  in  our State  for many months past  and  it  is unnecessary  for me  to  detain  you with a  recital of  the arguments  pertaining  to  these  measures,  stating  in  what  manner  proper  legislation  on  each  of  these  subjects would inure to the betterment of our people or for the commercial Interests of our State. CONCLUSIONS. I  wish  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  early  consideration  of  such  questions  as  are  of  state-wide significance. You will  serve best  the  freemen of Vermont  if you at once undertake  the  solution of  those broad questions, which will promote the interests of the great body of our people. The  work  of  the  session  ought  to  be  accomplished  as  quickly  and  speedily  as  is  consistent  with  a  good understanding and deliberate consideration of the problems you attempt to solve. You will  accomplish most  in my  judgment  by  undertaking  little.  In  the  short  space  of  a  single  session,  you will find  it  impossible  to correct all  the mistakes of  the past and enact all  the wise  legislation which  the present and future require. Let me advise, then, that from this day until adjournment you direct your entire attention to a few large matters that imperatively demand your consideration and action. I believe  I voice  the  sentiment of  the State  in asking  that your efforts be  so continuous and  so well directed that this General Assembly may complete its work and adjourn before Thanksgiving Day. During  your  service  here,  those  you  represent  expect  you  to  put  aside  all  personal  considerations  and  bend every energy to serve in word, thought and deed, the public weal.  Irrespective  of  party  affiliations,  the  men  of  Vermont  have  given  expression  to  their  views  upon  many questions about which there is a general consensus of opinion.  They will expect from you nothing less than that you  see  these measures written  into  the  laws of  this session. They will exact  from you  little more.  If you  fulfill their  expectations,  they will  approve your  action,  and  the  coming years will demonstrate  that Vermont  through your efforts has made substantial progress, political, moral and material. The Governor having concluded the reading of his message, withdrew, and the Joint Assembly dissolved. GUY W. BAILEY,         Secretary of State, Clerk.
